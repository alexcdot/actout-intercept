Mohammed said that when he first began plotting the attacks with terrorist leader Usama bin Laden (search) in 1996, the original scheme involved the hijacking of five commercial airliners on each U.S
coast, 10 planes in total.
After examining interrogation reports, The Associated Press learned that Mohammed said the that, in its final stages, the hijacking plan called for as many as 22 terrorists and four planes in a first wave. A second wave of suicide hijackings was to follow that were to be aided possibly by Al Qaeda allies in southeast Asia, U.S
officials confirmed to Fox News.
The interrogation reports make clear that Mohammed and Al Qaeda were still actively looking to strike U.S., Western and Israeli targets across the world as of this year.
Mohammed was captured in a March 1 raid by Pakistani forces and CIA operatives (search) in Rawalpindi.
He is being interrogated by the CIA at an undisclosed location.
Mohammed's interrogations have revealed the planning and training of operatives was extraordinarily meticulous, including how to blend into American society, read telephone yellow pages, and research airline schedules.
Over time, bin Laden scrapped various parts of the Sept.
11 plan, including attacks on both coasts and hijacking or bombing some planes in East Asia, Mohammed said that shed new light on the origins and evolution of the plot of Sept.
11, 2001.
Addressing one of the questions raised by congressional investigators in their Sept.
11 review, Mohammed said he never heard of a Saudi man named Omar al-Bayoumi who provided some rent money and assistance to two hijackers when they arrived in California.
Congressional investigators have suggested Bayoumi could have aided the hijackers or been a Saudi intelligence agent, charges the Saudi government vehemently deny.
The FBI has also cast doubt on the theory.
How Much He Aided the Hijackers.
Mohammed claims he did not arrange for anyone on U.S
soil to assist hijackers Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi.
He said there "were no Al Qaeda operatives or facilitators in the United States to help al-Mihdhar or al-Hazmi settle in the United States," one of the reports state.
Al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi were on the plane that was flown into the Pentagon.
Mohammed portrays those two hijackers as central to the plot, and even more important than Mohammed Atta, initially thought to be the ringleader.
Mohammed said he communicated with al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar while they were in the United States by using Internet chat software.
Mohammed said al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar were among the four original operatives bin Laden assigned to him for the plot; those were the only two hijackers whom U.S
authorities were frantically seeking for terrorist ties in the final days before Sept.
11.
Terrorism experts say the facts emerging from the interrogation report are quite revealing and give a clearer picture of how Al Qaeda operates.
"This news coming out that the plot was shrunk down is probably from an operational standpoint, they were afraid of the word getting out, leaking out," said Fox News military analyst Ret.
Navy Capt.
Chuck Nash.
"The more people you have involved, the more chance you have of being discovered."
Officials believe Mohammed knows the locations of many of the remaining Al Qaeda leaders.
They also say he was active in Al Qaeda's attempts to acquire chemical and biological weapons.
"The downside is this is all six months old now.
They're [ Al Qaeda's] trade craft is changing significantly," Brookes told Fox News on Monday.
"We need to be very careful in looking toward the future seeing how A Qaeda and other groups are changing their tactics."
Brookes noted that Al Qaeda may be looking to recruit people who wouldn't fit the traditional description of a terrorism -- looking, for example, for recruits from a variety of ethnic groups and countries that aren't known to be anti-American.
"Al Qaeda is changing their tactics so that they can continue to be as lethal as they have bee in the past," Brookes said.
U.S
authorities continue to investigate the many statements Mohammed made.
They have been able to corroborate with other captives and evidence much of his account.
Recruiting the Hijackers.
Mohammed said the hijacking teams were originally made up of members from different countries where Al Qaeda had recruited, but that later bin Laden chose to use a large group of young Saudi men.
Mohammed learned "there was a large group of Saudi operatives that would be available to participate as the muscle in the plot to hijack planes in the United States."
Saudi Arabia was bin Laden's home, though it revoked his citizenship in the 1990s.
Saudis have suggested that bin Laden has been trying to drive a wedge between the United States and their kingdom.
U.S
intelligence has suggested that Saudis were chosen because there were large numbers willing to follow bin Laden and they could more easily get into the United States because of the countries' friendly relations.
Mohammed said some of the original operatives has trouble getting into the United States.
Mohammed said he had worked in 1994 and 1995 in the Philippines with Ramzi Yousef, Abdul Hakim Murad and Wali Khan Amin Shah on the foiled Bojinka plot to blow up 12 Western airliners simultaneously in Asia.
In 1996, he went to meet bin Laden to persuade the Al Qaeda leader "to give him money and operatives so he could hijack 10 planes in the United States and fly them into targets," one of the interrogation reports state.
The first major change to the plans occurred in 1999 when the two Yemeni operatives could not get U.S
visas.
Bin Laden offered additional operatives, including a member of his personal security detail.
The original two Yemenis were instructed to focus on hijacking planes in East Asia.
Mohammed considered using a scaled-down version of the Bojinka plan that would have bombed commercial airliners, and that he even considered using shoe bombs.
The plot, he said, eventually evolved into hijacking a small number of planes in the United States and East Asia and either having them explode or crash into targets simultaneously.
By 1999, the four original operatives picked for the plot traveled to Afghanistan to train at one of bin Laden's camps.
The focus was on specialized commando training, not piloting jets.
A key event in the plot, Mohammed said, was a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in January 2000, that included al-Mihdhar, al-Hazmi and other Al Qaeda operatives.
The CIA had the meeting monitored by Malaysian security, but it did not realize the significance of the two eventual hijackers until just before the attacks.
In spring 2000, bin Laden canceled the idea for hijackings in East Asia because he thought "it would be too difficult to synchronize" attacks in the United States and Asia.
Mohammed reached out to an Al Qaeda linked group in southeast Asia, Jemaah Islamiyah.
He began "recruiting JI operatives for inclusion in the hijacking plot as part of his second wave of hijacking attacks to occur after Sept.
11," one report summary said.
An operative of Jemaah Islamiyah's operations chief, Riduan Isamuddin Hambali, later began training possible recruits for the second wave of attacks.
One of those who received training in Malaysia before coming to the United States was Zacarias Moussaoui, the Frenchman accused of conspiring with the Sept.
11 attacks.
Moussaoui has denied being part of the Sept.
11 plot, and U.S
and foreign intelligence officials have said he could have been set for hijacking a plane in later attacks.
WASHINGTON –  Usama bin Laden (search ) made his first televised appearance in more than a year Friday in which he admitted for the first time ordering the Sept.
11 attacks and accused President Bush of "misleading" the American people.
Injecting himself into the campaign four days ahead of the presidential election, bin Laden said the United States can avoid another Sept.
11-style attack if it stops threatening the security of Muslims.
In the portion of the tape that was broadcast, the Al Qaeda (search) leader refrained from directly warning of new attacks, although he said "there are still reasons to repeat what happened."
"Your security is not in the hands of Kerry, Bush or Al Qaeda.
Your security is in your own hands," bin Laden said, referring to the president and his Democratic opponent.
"Any state that does not mess with our security, has naturally guaranteed its own security."
Admitting for the first time that he ordered the Sept.
11 attacks, bin Laden said he did so because of injustices against the Lebanese and Palestinians by Israel and the United States.
In what appeared to be conciliatory language, bin Laden said he wanted to explain why he ordered the airline hijackings that hit the World Trade Center (search) and the Pentagon so Americans would know how to act to prevent another attack.
"To the American people, my talk is to you about the best way to avoid another Manhattan," he said.
"I tell you: Security is an important element of human life and free people do not give up their security."
After the video was aired, President Bush said that "Americans will not be intimidated" by bin Laden.
Sen.
John Kerry criticized Bush for failing to capture bin Laden earlier and said that "I can run a more effective war on terror."
The political impact of the tape could cut both ways.
It bolsters Bush's argument that the world is a dangerous place and plays to his strength as commander in chief in fighting the war on terror, but it also underscores that his administration has failed to capture or kill America's No.
1 enemy more than three years after the terror attacks on New York and Washington.
It was the first footage in more than a year of the fugitive Al Qaeda leader, thought to be hiding in the mountains along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
The video, broadcast on Al-Jazeera television, showed bin Laden with a long, gray beard, wearing traditional white robes, a turban and a golden cloak, standing behind a table with papers and in front of a plain, brown curtain.
The Bush administration said it believes the videotape is authentic and was made recently, noting that bin Laden referred to 1,000 U.S
military deaths in Iraq -- which happened in early September.
White House press secretary Scott McClellan said the administration did not plan to raise the nation's threat level for now.
The U.S
official said the 18-minute tape -- which carries English subtitles, though not in the portion shown on Al-Jazeera -- lacks an explicit threat and repeats well-worn themes.
Multiple sources told FOX News that the tape is authentic and that it was made recently.
Al-Jazeera, which is based in Qatar, broadcast about seven minutes of the tape.
The station's spokesman, Jihad Ali Ballout, said Al-Jazeera aired what was "newsworthy and relevant" and refused to describe the unaired portions, including whether they included any threats.
Ballout said the station received the tape Friday but would not say how.
Before the tape was aired, the State Department asked the government of Qatar to discourage Al-Jazeera from broadcasting it, a senior State Department official said.
In the video, bin Laden accused Bush of misleading Americans by saying the attack was carried out because Al Qaeda "hates freedom." The terrorist leader said his followers have left alone countries that do not threaten Muslims.
He said he was first inspired to attack the United States by the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon in which towers and buildings in Beirut were destroyed in the siege of the capital.
"While I was looking at these destroyed towers in Lebanon, it sparked in my mind that the tyrant should be punished with the same and that we should destroy towers in America, so that it tastes what we taste and would be deterred from killing our children and women," he said.
"God knows that it had not occurred to our mind to attack the towers, but after our patience ran out and we saw the injustice and inflexibility of the American-Israeli alliance toward our people in Palestine and Lebanon, this came to my mind," he said.
Bin Laden suggested Bush was slow to react to the Sept.
11 attacks, giving the hijackers more time than they expected.
At the time of the attacks, the president was listening to schoolchildren in Florida reading a book.
"It never occurred to us that the commander in chief of the American armed forces would leave 50,000 of his citizens in the two towers to face these horrors alone," he said, referring to the number of people who worked at the World Trade Center.
"It appeared to him [Bush] that a little girl's talk about her goat and its butting was more important than the planes and their butting of the skyscrapers.
That gave us three times the required time to carry out the operations, thank God," he said.
Excluding the hijackers, the Sept.
11 attacks killed 2,749 people at the World Trade Center, 184 at the Pentagon and 40 in Pennsylvania.
In planning the attacks, bin Laden said he told Mohammed Atta, one of the hijackers, that the strikes had to be carried out "within 20 minutes before Bush and his administration noticed."
Bin Laden compared the Bush administration to repressive Arab regimes "in that half of them are ruled by the military and the other half are ruled by the sons of kings and presidents."
He said the resemblance became clear when Bush's father was president and visited Arab countries.
"He wound up being impressed by the royal and military regimes and envied them for staying decades in their positions and embezzling the nation's money with no supervision," bin Laden said.
"He passed on tyranny and oppression to his son, and they called it the Patriot Act, under the pretext of fighting terror.
Bush the father did well in placing his sons as governors and did not forget to pass on the expertise in fraud from the leaders of the (Mideast) region to Florida to use it in critical moments."
The image of bin Laden reading a statement was dramatically different from the few other videos of the Al Qaeda leader that have emerged since the Sept.
11 attacks.
In the last videotape, issued Sept.
10, 2003, bin Laden is seen walking through rocky terrain with his top deputy Ayman al-Zawahri, both carrying automatic rifles.
In a taped message issued at the same time, bin Laden praises the "great damage to the enemy" on Sept.
11 and mentions five hijackers by name.
In December 2001, the Pentagon released a videotape in which bin Laden is shown at a dinner with associates in Afghanistan on Nov.
9, 2001, saying the destruction of the Sept.
11 attacks exceeded even his "optimistic" calculations.
But in none of his previous messages, audio or video, did bin Laden directly state that he ordered the attacks.
The last audiotape purportedly from bin Laden came in April.
The speaker on the tape, which CIA analysts said likely was the Al Qaeda leader, offered a truce to European nations if they pull troops out of Muslim countries.
The tape referred to the March 22 assassination by Israel of Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin.
Retired Lt.
Col.
Bill Cowen, a FOX News military analyst, said bin Laden timed the tape deliberately.
"I think he's just trying to slap the president around a little bit and in my opinion is trying to influence the election," Cowen said.
Cowen said that while the tape showed that the most wanted terrorist was still at large, it also should be seen in another light.
"This tape is also a reminder of how we've decimated the top Al Qaeda leadership," Cowen said.
"It took us 20 years to find Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, right here in the United States."
Watch The O'Reilly Factor weeknights at 8 p.m
and 11 p.m
ET and listen to the Radio Factor!.
BILL O'REILLY, HOST:  In the Factor "Follow-Up" segment tonight, as we told you before, the Democratic Party is split between people who sincerely want effective change under our present system and those who want to destroy the system because they think it's evil.
Comedian George Carlin is one of the latter.
GEORGE CARLIN, COMEDIAN:  This country has been pushing the world around and exploiting the people of the world for a long, long time, and sometimes you have to pay the piper, and that's what happened to us.
O'REILLY:  All right.  The key words there are "exploiting the people of the world."
Joining us now from San Francisco is Paul Waldman, the editor and chief of a "Gadflyer," a left-wing Internet magazine and author of the book "Fraud: The Strategy Behind the Bush Lies and Why the Media Didn't Tell You," and from Los Angeles, UCLA Film Professor Richard Walter, who we'll begin with.
Now, Professor, I mean I know -- we've talked on this broadcast.  We disagree on most things, but you're a rational thinker, I believe.  You don't think the United States is responsible for 9/11 and brought this terrorism on itself, do you?
RICHARD WALTER, UCLA FILM PROFESSOR:  No, I don't, and I think that Carlin sounds like Jerry Falwell who blamed the -- what was it -- the lesbians and the American Civil Liberties Union.
No, I think what these people around the world hate about us has nothing to do with anything that we do that is wrong.  I think they don't like the same things that you don't like about us, our culture.
They don't like our music, they don't like our movies, they don't like that kind of influence, that middle-class bourgeois message that we send around the world, and they don't like the American dream in particular, which is a dream that, I think, you do embrace, something that we do agree about, which is that, if you work real hard, you know, if you get educated, in America, you can move up from your lower station.
WALTER:  No, they don't.  They do not.  No, no, no.  There is not a monolithic united view on the left, any more than there is in Hollywood, any more than there is on the right.  On the right, as you know, there are people who support Bush, there are people who bash him.  There's a lot of diversity of opinion.  And Carlin speaks for Carlin, and I think what he says is kind of silly.
PAUL WALDMAN, AUTHOR, "FRAUD":  Well, you know, this is the kind of thing that conservatives love to caricature, to beat up on progressives about, and I didn't hear George Carlin say that we deserved to get attacked and that those people deserved to die.
O'REILLY:  ..
quite clearly that, because we have exploited the people of the world, we have to pay the piper, and they were talking about terrorism.  So...
He basically feels that we're an evil country, we've damaged people the world over, exploited those people, and they understandably, in his opinion, have lashed out and attacked us.
WALDMAN:  Not completely, but I think that there are things that the U.S
government has done in the past that have helped in some way contribute to terrorism.  That doesn't mean that's what we meant to do, that doesn't mean that we should be blamed, but it does mean that we have to understand those things so we can help to prevent further terrorist acts in the future.
O'REILLY:  ..
evil enterprise, all right?  See, President Bush says the evildoers are the Al Qaeda.  Carlin and his pals say the evildoers are within.  What do you say?
We had troops in Saudi Arabia.  That became the focus of a lot of anger for a lot of people in the Muslim world.  It doesn't mean it was necessarily right for them to be angry.  But if we had understood that anger and how it was building, maybe we would have been a little more attentive to the threat that came from al Qaeda.
And I feel bad for Carlin.  He's a talented guy but a bitter guy.  And I know him somewhat.  He hates the United States of America.  He won't ever cop to that, but he does.
But they'll take his words and they'll wrap it around the throat of the progressive community and pull.  So I think Carlin does more harm to liberals than he does to anybody else, Professor.  How do you see it?
WALTER:  No, they -- among students on college campuses -- once again, contrary to the kinds of messages that you put out, there is a great diversity of opinion.  A great diversity of opinion.
But you're absolutely right, Bill.  This will be exploited by the right wing to tar, you know, with a great, big, broad brush what is actually a diversity of views.
Most of the people, I think, on the left that I know -- most liberals that I know love this country.  They do not blame America for what happened on September 11 any more than Israel is responsible for the attacks on Israel.
Israel was never attacked -- was always attacked -- excuse me -- long before it was in the territories, from the very beginning.  There's nothing that Israel can do that is going to satisfy the people who hate it, and likewise...
WALTER:  ..
the terrorists against us are never going to be satisfied.  Never, never, never.
O'REILLY:  And I think -- Mr.
Waldman, maybe you disagree with this, but I think the reason the terrorists hurt us -- hate us the most is because of our support for Israel, because that's the number one recruiting tool that bin Usama Laden and his evildoers use, that the Jews and the Americans and they're together and this and that.
But, look, as I said, there's a wide diversity of opinion within the progressive community.  Some want to work within the structure of the USA to improve the lot of the poor, whatever it may be.  Others want to say, look, we have a bad society, we need to be socialistic, we need to be X and Y.
And you, sir, from reading your Internet Web site, I think, are in the latter.  You really want a fundamental change in this society.
WALDMAN:  No, no, no, Bill.  Bill, that is completely unfair to say that important parts of the progressive community want to overthrow the system.
You know, that's just a conservative caricature, and what conservatives do is they find things that somebody like a comedian or an actor will say, and they caricature them, and they say, ah-ha, this is what the entire left believes.
Well, that's just ridiculous.  I, like everybody that I know in the progressive community, loves America and loves democracy, and that's why I criticize President Bush.  That's why I wrote a whole book about it.
WALDMAN:  I think capitalism is a great system, but I think it also needs the involvement of government in order to function properly.
WALDMAN:  That's the difference between...
WALDMAN:  ..
between the right wing...
WALDMAN:  Oh, no, absolutely not.  I think that most Americans understand now, as we've seen with things like the Enron debacle, that capitalism only function if you've got a government that is fulfilling its role as a watchdog and setting the rules.
Professor Walter, I'm going to give you the last word on this.  If George Carlin was sitting here today, if he had enough cahonas to come in, what would you tell him?
WALTER:  Well, I love free-enterprise capitalism.  I think it needs to be regulated.  I don't think it's fair to tar all of corporate America for what Enron did, even though there's a lot of that that goes on.  It's not the rule.
The problem is this monolithic view that people take, and, as much as I admire you, I do worry about your contributions to -- and I think the medium of television and mass media in general tilt this way -- towards keeping everything black and white, everything simple.
WALTER:  ..
and we have to live with the stress and the tension of...
All right.  Gentlemen, we appreciate you taking the time.
SCARBOROUGH, Maine –  A former U.S
Airways ticket agent who issued boarding passes to the terrorists who later hijacked a plane out of Boston on Sept.
11, 2001, says he felt guilty afterward.
Atta's demeanor, his angry-looking eyes and the pair's first-class, one-way tickets to Los Angeles made Tuohey think twice.
"I said to myself, 'If this guy doesn't look like an Arab terrorist, then nothing does.' Then I gave myself a mental slap, because in this day and age, it's not nice to say things like this," Tuohey told the Maine Sunday Telegram
"You've checked in hundreds of Arabs and Hindus and Sikhs, and you've never done that.
I felt kind of embarrassed."
A few hours later, Tuohey was blaming himself as he watched news reports of the attacks on the World Trade Center.
After leaving Portland on a 6 a.m
flight, Atta and Alomari landed in Boston, where they joined three other hijackers on American Airlines Flight 11 (search), which they crashed into one of the twin towers.
Five other hijackers left Boston around the same time and crashed United Airlines Flight 175 (search) into the other tower.
Tuohey, 58, said he felt at least partly responsible in the days following the attacks.
Law enforcement officials believe Atta, mastermind of the Sept.
11 attacks, started his day in Portland — about 100 miles from Boston — to avoid having all the hijackers arrive at once at Logan International Airport (search).
"It just sent chills through you.
You see his picture in the paper (now)," Tuohey said.
"You see more life in that picture than there is in flesh and blood."
After the attacks, Tuohey had a gut feeling the two men were involved.
After going home, he was called back to the airport to talk to an FBI agent and picked Atta and Alomari out on a security video without any doubt.
A few weeks later, another investigator came by Tuohey's house and showed him a large number of pictures and asked him to point out the men he had waited on that day.
"I went right to Atta," Tuohey said.
"It's like the skull on a poison bottle.
There's no mistaking that face."
The chairman of the federal commission investigating Sept.
11 (search) said Wednesday the terrorist attacks could have been prevented.
"As you read the report, you're going to have a pretty clear idea of what wasn't done and what should have been done," he told one television station.
The comments were the first by Kean, former Republican governor of New Jersey, blaming public officials for not anticipating the attacks.
"There are people that, certainly, if I was doing the job, who would certainly not be in the position they were in at the time because they failed," he said.
Kean didn't name names but it has previously been reported that the Bush administration received intelligence warnings that provided hints about Usama bin Laden's (search) intentions before Sept.
11.
WASHINGTON –  The Sept.
11 attacks shattered the American sense of freedom, casting the very idea of freedom in a new light.
They also raised the question of whether Americans should be willing to surrender some of their rights in exchange for security against terror.
Americans may take for granted that they are protected from government intrusion.
But federal agents have enjoyed expanded investigatory powers in the wake of Sept.
11 that allow them more than ever to track e-mail, poke through financial transactions, peruse library and consumer histories -- even sign up neighbors to spy.
"I believe some of these tools would have helped in the events of 9/11," said security consultant Bill Daly. "I'm not saying it would have stopped 9/11 from occurring, but they would have been helpful tools for law enforcement and intelligence agencies
I think now the time is right to be able to use them."
Before Sept.
11, the federal government already had wide-ranging powers to secure warrants.
But new authority under the USA Patriot Act has broadened those powers, and has made it easier for agents to conduct their surveillance.
Critics say law-abiding citizens' rights are being abridged, while terrorists will continue to subvert the law.
They also fear the government is setting a dangerous precedent with new spying powers that might be abused in the future by less well-meaning administrations.
"I think it raises real serious concerns for the potential precedents they set and how they might be abused down the road," said James Lyndsey, an analyst with the Brookings Institution.
"I think if you actually look at Sept.
11 ..
it's not at all clear that civil liberties were the problem," Lyndsey continued.
"What really seemed to be the problem was foremost a lack of vigilance, a real lack of conviction within the American public, within the federal government, that a catastrophic terrorist attack could really happen here in the United States."
But that's why Americans should not be wary about giving the government the tools it needs to prevent another terrorist attack, say supporters of increased security measures.
The Patriot Act also allows the government to indefinitely detain immigrants -- even permanent residents -- without criminal charges.
Profiling for Middle Easterners and Arabs has become a major debate as airport officials and law enforcement officials try to plug the holes in the nation's security.
Some point out the terrorists who committed the heinous Sept.
11 attacks share a common thread: They are all radical Muslims with Middle Eastern and Arab backgrounds.
So, they reason, targeting men who fit that description is not only common sense -- it's a necessary law enforcement tool.
"Usama bin Laden has called on all Muslims to destroy Americans," said Heather MacDonald, of the Manhattan Institute.
"He has not called on all Jews or Catholics to destroy Americans -- it's a Muslim appeal.
Law enforcement needs to keep that in mind."
Arab-American advocates have a different take on the situation.
"A profile is a whole bunch of behavioral characteristics of which race or religion or gender may be one," said Jean Abinader, of the Arab American Institute.
"The problem is when you give it to people who are untrained in the situation or who are looking for shortcuts, race becomes the dominant feature and that's where profiling fails."
John Whitehead of the Rutherford Institute says treating potentially innocent people as though they were criminals is not the American way.
Mohammed said that when he first began plotting the attacks with terrorist leader Usama bin Laden (search) in 1996, the original scheme involved the hijacking of five commercial airliners on each U.S
coast, 10 planes in total.
After examining interrogation reports, The Associated Press learned that Mohammed said the that, in its final stages, the hijacking plan called for as many as 22 terrorists and four planes in a first wave. A second wave of suicide hijackings was to follow that were to be aided possibly by Al Qaeda allies in southeast Asia, U.S
officials confirmed to Fox News.
The interrogation reports make clear that Mohammed and Al Qaeda were still actively looking to strike U.S., Western and Israeli targets across the world as of this year.
Mohammed was captured in a March 1 raid by Pakistani forces and CIA operatives (search) in Rawalpindi.
He is being interrogated by the CIA at an undisclosed location.
Mohammed's interrogations have revealed the planning and training of operatives was extraordinarily meticulous, including how to blend into American society, read telephone yellow pages, and research airline schedules.
Over time, bin Laden scrapped various parts of the Sept.
11 plan, including attacks on both coasts and hijacking or bombing some planes in East Asia, Mohammed said that shed new light on the origins and evolution of the plot of Sept.
11, 2001.
Addressing one of the questions raised by congressional investigators in their Sept.
11 review, Mohammed said he never heard of a Saudi man named Omar al-Bayoumi who provided some rent money and assistance to two hijackers when they arrived in California.
Congressional investigators have suggested Bayoumi could have aided the hijackers or been a Saudi intelligence agent, charges the Saudi government vehemently deny.
The FBI has also cast doubt on the theory.
How Much He Aided the Hijackers.
Mohammed claims he did not arrange for anyone on U.S
soil to assist hijackers Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi.
He said there "were no Al Qaeda operatives or facilitators in the United States to help al-Mihdhar or al-Hazmi settle in the United States," one of the reports state.
Al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi were on the plane that was flown into the Pentagon.
Mohammed portrays those two hijackers as central to the plot, and even more important than Mohammed Atta, initially thought to be the ringleader.
Mohammed said he communicated with al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar while they were in the United States by using Internet chat software.
Mohammed said al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar were among the four original operatives bin Laden assigned to him for the plot; those were the only two hijackers whom U.S
authorities were frantically seeking for terrorist ties in the final days before Sept.
11.
Terrorism experts say the facts emerging from the interrogation report are quite revealing and give a clearer picture of how Al Qaeda operates.
"This news coming out that the plot was shrunk down is probably from an operational standpoint, they were afraid of the word getting out, leaking out," said Fox News military analyst Ret.
Navy Capt.
Chuck Nash.
"The more people you have involved, the more chance you have of being discovered."
Officials believe Mohammed knows the locations of many of the remaining Al Qaeda leaders.
They also say he was active in Al Qaeda's attempts to acquire chemical and biological weapons.
"The downside is this is all six months old now.
They're [ Al Qaeda's] trade craft is changing significantly," Brookes told Fox News on Monday.
"We need to be very careful in looking toward the future seeing how A Qaeda and other groups are changing their tactics."
Brookes noted that Al Qaeda may be looking to recruit people who wouldn't fit the traditional description of a terrorism -- looking, for example, for recruits from a variety of ethnic groups and countries that aren't known to be anti-American.
"Al Qaeda is changing their tactics so that they can continue to be as lethal as they have bee in the past," Brookes said.
U.S
authorities continue to investigate the many statements Mohammed made.
They have been able to corroborate with other captives and evidence much of his account.
Recruiting the Hijackers.
Mohammed said the hijacking teams were originally made up of members from different countries where Al Qaeda had recruited, but that later bin Laden chose to use a large group of young Saudi men.
Mohammed learned "there was a large group of Saudi operatives that would be available to participate as the muscle in the plot to hijack planes in the United States."
Saudi Arabia was bin Laden's home, though it revoked his citizenship in the 1990s.
Saudis have suggested that bin Laden has been trying to drive a wedge between the United States and their kingdom.
U.S
intelligence has suggested that Saudis were chosen because there were large numbers willing to follow bin Laden and they could more easily get into the United States because of the countries' friendly relations.
Mohammed said some of the original operatives has trouble getting into the United States.
Mohammed said he had worked in 1994 and 1995 in the Philippines with Ramzi Yousef, Abdul Hakim Murad and Wali Khan Amin Shah on the foiled Bojinka plot to blow up 12 Western airliners simultaneously in Asia.
In 1996, he went to meet bin Laden to persuade the Al Qaeda leader "to give him money and operatives so he could hijack 10 planes in the United States and fly them into targets," one of the interrogation reports state.
The first major change to the plans occurred in 1999 when the two Yemeni operatives could not get U.S
visas.
Bin Laden offered additional operatives, including a member of his personal security detail.
The original two Yemenis were instructed to focus on hijacking planes in East Asia.
Mohammed considered using a scaled-down version of the Bojinka plan that would have bombed commercial airliners, and that he even considered using shoe bombs.
The plot, he said, eventually evolved into hijacking a small number of planes in the United States and East Asia and either having them explode or crash into targets simultaneously.
By 1999, the four original operatives picked for the plot traveled to Afghanistan to train at one of bin Laden's camps.
The focus was on specialized commando training, not piloting jets.
A key event in the plot, Mohammed said, was a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in January 2000, that included al-Mihdhar, al-Hazmi and other Al Qaeda operatives.
The CIA had the meeting monitored by Malaysian security, but it did not realize the significance of the two eventual hijackers until just before the attacks.
In spring 2000, bin Laden canceled the idea for hijackings in East Asia because he thought "it would be too difficult to synchronize" attacks in the United States and Asia.
Mohammed reached out to an Al Qaeda linked group in southeast Asia, Jemaah Islamiyah.
He began "recruiting JI operatives for inclusion in the hijacking plot as part of his second wave of hijacking attacks to occur after Sept.
11," one report summary said.
An operative of Jemaah Islamiyah's operations chief, Riduan Isamuddin Hambali, later began training possible recruits for the second wave of attacks.
One of those who received training in Malaysia before coming to the United States was Zacarias Moussaoui, the Frenchman accused of conspiring with the Sept.
11 attacks.
Moussaoui has denied being part of the Sept.
11 plot, and U.S
and foreign intelligence officials have said he could have been set for hijacking a plane in later attacks.
WASHINGTON –  Usama bin Laden (search ) made his first televised appearance in more than a year Friday in which he admitted for the first time ordering the Sept.
11 attacks and accused President Bush of "misleading" the American people.
Injecting himself into the campaign four days ahead of the presidential election, bin Laden said the United States can avoid another Sept.
11-style attack if it stops threatening the security of Muslims.
In the portion of the tape that was broadcast, the Al Qaeda (search) leader refrained from directly warning of new attacks, although he said "there are still reasons to repeat what happened."
"Your security is not in the hands of Kerry, Bush or Al Qaeda.
Your security is in your own hands," bin Laden said, referring to the president and his Democratic opponent.
"Any state that does not mess with our security, has naturally guaranteed its own security."
Admitting for the first time that he ordered the Sept.
11 attacks, bin Laden said he did so because of injustices against the Lebanese and Palestinians by Israel and the United States.
In what appeared to be conciliatory language, bin Laden said he wanted to explain why he ordered the airline hijackings that hit the World Trade Center (search) and the Pentagon so Americans would know how to act to prevent another attack.
"To the American people, my talk is to you about the best way to avoid another Manhattan," he said.
"I tell you: Security is an important element of human life and free people do not give up their security."
After the video was aired, President Bush said that "Americans will not be intimidated" by bin Laden.
Sen.
John Kerry criticized Bush for failing to capture bin Laden earlier and said that "I can run a more effective war on terror."
The political impact of the tape could cut both ways.
It bolsters Bush's argument that the world is a dangerous place and plays to his strength as commander in chief in fighting the war on terror, but it also underscores that his administration has failed to capture or kill America's No.
1 enemy more than three years after the terror attacks on New York and Washington.
It was the first footage in more than a year of the fugitive Al Qaeda leader, thought to be hiding in the mountains along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
The video, broadcast on Al-Jazeera television, showed bin Laden with a long, gray beard, wearing traditional white robes, a turban and a golden cloak, standing behind a table with papers and in front of a plain, brown curtain.
The Bush administration said it believes the videotape is authentic and was made recently, noting that bin Laden referred to 1,000 U.S
military deaths in Iraq -- which happened in early September.
White House press secretary Scott McClellan said the administration did not plan to raise the nation's threat level for now.
The U.S
official said the 18-minute tape -- which carries English subtitles, though not in the portion shown on Al-Jazeera -- lacks an explicit threat and repeats well-worn themes.
Multiple sources told FOX News that the tape is authentic and that it was made recently.
Al-Jazeera, which is based in Qatar, broadcast about seven minutes of the tape.
The station's spokesman, Jihad Ali Ballout, said Al-Jazeera aired what was "newsworthy and relevant" and refused to describe the unaired portions, including whether they included any threats.
Ballout said the station received the tape Friday but would not say how.
Before the tape was aired, the State Department asked the government of Qatar to discourage Al-Jazeera from broadcasting it, a senior State Department official said.
In the video, bin Laden accused Bush of misleading Americans by saying the attack was carried out because Al Qaeda "hates freedom." The terrorist leader said his followers have left alone countries that do not threaten Muslims.
He said he was first inspired to attack the United States by the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon in which towers and buildings in Beirut were destroyed in the siege of the capital.
"While I was looking at these destroyed towers in Lebanon, it sparked in my mind that the tyrant should be punished with the same and that we should destroy towers in America, so that it tastes what we taste and would be deterred from killing our children and women," he said.
"God knows that it had not occurred to our mind to attack the towers, but after our patience ran out and we saw the injustice and inflexibility of the American-Israeli alliance toward our people in Palestine and Lebanon, this came to my mind," he said.
Bin Laden suggested Bush was slow to react to the Sept.
11 attacks, giving the hijackers more time than they expected.
At the time of the attacks, the president was listening to schoolchildren in Florida reading a book.
"It never occurred to us that the commander in chief of the American armed forces would leave 50,000 of his citizens in the two towers to face these horrors alone," he said, referring to the number of people who worked at the World Trade Center.
"It appeared to him [Bush] that a little girl's talk about her goat and its butting was more important than the planes and their butting of the skyscrapers.
That gave us three times the required time to carry out the operations, thank God," he said.
Excluding the hijackers, the Sept.
11 attacks killed 2,749 people at the World Trade Center, 184 at the Pentagon and 40 in Pennsylvania.
In planning the attacks, bin Laden said he told Mohammed Atta, one of the hijackers, that the strikes had to be carried out "within 20 minutes before Bush and his administration noticed."
Bin Laden compared the Bush administration to repressive Arab regimes "in that half of them are ruled by the military and the other half are ruled by the sons of kings and presidents."
He said the resemblance became clear when Bush's father was president and visited Arab countries.
"He wound up being impressed by the royal and military regimes and envied them for staying decades in their positions and embezzling the nation's money with no supervision," bin Laden said.
"He passed on tyranny and oppression to his son, and they called it the Patriot Act, under the pretext of fighting terror.
Bush the father did well in placing his sons as governors and did not forget to pass on the expertise in fraud from the leaders of the (Mideast) region to Florida to use it in critical moments."
The image of bin Laden reading a statement was dramatically different from the few other videos of the Al Qaeda leader that have emerged since the Sept.
11 attacks.
In the last videotape, issued Sept.
10, 2003, bin Laden is seen walking through rocky terrain with his top deputy Ayman al-Zawahri, both carrying automatic rifles.
In a taped message issued at the same time, bin Laden praises the "great damage to the enemy" on Sept.
11 and mentions five hijackers by name.
In December 2001, the Pentagon released a videotape in which bin Laden is shown at a dinner with associates in Afghanistan on Nov.
9, 2001, saying the destruction of the Sept.
11 attacks exceeded even his "optimistic" calculations.
But in none of his previous messages, audio or video, did bin Laden directly state that he ordered the attacks.
The last audiotape purportedly from bin Laden came in April.
The speaker on the tape, which CIA analysts said likely was the Al Qaeda leader, offered a truce to European nations if they pull troops out of Muslim countries.
The tape referred to the March 22 assassination by Israel of Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin.
Retired Lt.
Col.
Bill Cowen, a FOX News military analyst, said bin Laden timed the tape deliberately.
"I think he's just trying to slap the president around a little bit and in my opinion is trying to influence the election," Cowen said.
Cowen said that while the tape showed that the most wanted terrorist was still at large, it also should be seen in another light.
"This tape is also a reminder of how we've decimated the top Al Qaeda leadership," Cowen said.
"It took us 20 years to find Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, right here in the United States."
Watch The O'Reilly Factor weeknights at 8 p.m
and 11 p.m
ET and listen to the Radio Factor!.
BILL O'REILLY, HOST:  In the Factor "Follow-Up" segment tonight, as we told you before, the Democratic Party is split between people who sincerely want effective change under our present system and those who want to destroy the system because they think it's evil.
Comedian George Carlin is one of the latter.
GEORGE CARLIN, COMEDIAN:  This country has been pushing the world around and exploiting the people of the world for a long, long time, and sometimes you have to pay the piper, and that's what happened to us.
O'REILLY:  All right.  The key words there are "exploiting the people of the world."
Joining us now from San Francisco is Paul Waldman, the editor and chief of a "Gadflyer," a left-wing Internet magazine and author of the book "Fraud: The Strategy Behind the Bush Lies and Why the Media Didn't Tell You," and from Los Angeles, UCLA Film Professor Richard Walter, who we'll begin with.
Now, Professor, I mean I know -- we've talked on this broadcast.  We disagree on most things, but you're a rational thinker, I believe.  You don't think the United States is responsible for 9/11 and brought this terrorism on itself, do you?
RICHARD WALTER, UCLA FILM PROFESSOR:  No, I don't, and I think that Carlin sounds like Jerry Falwell who blamed the -- what was it -- the lesbians and the American Civil Liberties Union.
No, I think what these people around the world hate about us has nothing to do with anything that we do that is wrong.  I think they don't like the same things that you don't like about us, our culture.
They don't like our music, they don't like our movies, they don't like that kind of influence, that middle-class bourgeois message that we send around the world, and they don't like the American dream in particular, which is a dream that, I think, you do embrace, something that we do agree about, which is that, if you work real hard, you know, if you get educated, in America, you can move up from your lower station.
WALTER:  No, they don't.  They do not.  No, no, no.  There is not a monolithic united view on the left, any more than there is in Hollywood, any more than there is on the right.  On the right, as you know, there are people who support Bush, there are people who bash him.  There's a lot of diversity of opinion.  And Carlin speaks for Carlin, and I think what he says is kind of silly.
PAUL WALDMAN, AUTHOR, "FRAUD":  Well, you know, this is the kind of thing that conservatives love to caricature, to beat up on progressives about, and I didn't hear George Carlin say that we deserved to get attacked and that those people deserved to die.
O'REILLY:  ..
quite clearly that, because we have exploited the people of the world, we have to pay the piper, and they were talking about terrorism.  So...
He basically feels that we're an evil country, we've damaged people the world over, exploited those people, and they understandably, in his opinion, have lashed out and attacked us.
WALDMAN:  Not completely, but I think that there are things that the U.S
government has done in the past that have helped in some way contribute to terrorism.  That doesn't mean that's what we meant to do, that doesn't mean that we should be blamed, but it does mean that we have to understand those things so we can help to prevent further terrorist acts in the future.
O'REILLY:  ..
evil enterprise, all right?  See, President Bush says the evildoers are the Al Qaeda.  Carlin and his pals say the evildoers are within.  What do you say?
We had troops in Saudi Arabia.  That became the focus of a lot of anger for a lot of people in the Muslim world.  It doesn't mean it was necessarily right for them to be angry.  But if we had understood that anger and how it was building, maybe we would have been a little more attentive to the threat that came from al Qaeda.
And I feel bad for Carlin.  He's a talented guy but a bitter guy.  And I know him somewhat.  He hates the United States of America.  He won't ever cop to that, but he does.
But they'll take his words and they'll wrap it around the throat of the progressive community and pull.  So I think Carlin does more harm to liberals than he does to anybody else, Professor.  How do you see it?
WALTER:  No, they -- among students on college campuses -- once again, contrary to the kinds of messages that you put out, there is a great diversity of opinion.  A great diversity of opinion.
But you're absolutely right, Bill.  This will be exploited by the right wing to tar, you know, with a great, big, broad brush what is actually a diversity of views.
Most of the people, I think, on the left that I know -- most liberals that I know love this country.  They do not blame America for what happened on September 11 any more than Israel is responsible for the attacks on Israel.
Israel was never attacked -- was always attacked -- excuse me -- long before it was in the territories, from the very beginning.  There's nothing that Israel can do that is going to satisfy the people who hate it, and likewise...
WALTER:  ..
the terrorists against us are never going to be satisfied.  Never, never, never.
O'REILLY:  And I think -- Mr.
Waldman, maybe you disagree with this, but I think the reason the terrorists hurt us -- hate us the most is because of our support for Israel, because that's the number one recruiting tool that bin Usama Laden and his evildoers use, that the Jews and the Americans and they're together and this and that.
But, look, as I said, there's a wide diversity of opinion within the progressive community.  Some want to work within the structure of the USA to improve the lot of the poor, whatever it may be.  Others want to say, look, we have a bad society, we need to be socialistic, we need to be X and Y.
And you, sir, from reading your Internet Web site, I think, are in the latter.  You really want a fundamental change in this society.
WALDMAN:  No, no, no, Bill.  Bill, that is completely unfair to say that important parts of the progressive community want to overthrow the system.
You know, that's just a conservative caricature, and what conservatives do is they find things that somebody like a comedian or an actor will say, and they caricature them, and they say, ah-ha, this is what the entire left believes.
Well, that's just ridiculous.  I, like everybody that I know in the progressive community, loves America and loves democracy, and that's why I criticize President Bush.  That's why I wrote a whole book about it.
WALDMAN:  I think capitalism is a great system, but I think it also needs the involvement of government in order to function properly.
WALDMAN:  That's the difference between...
WALDMAN:  ..
between the right wing...
WALDMAN:  Oh, no, absolutely not.  I think that most Americans understand now, as we've seen with things like the Enron debacle, that capitalism only function if you've got a government that is fulfilling its role as a watchdog and setting the rules.
Professor Walter, I'm going to give you the last word on this.  If George Carlin was sitting here today, if he had enough cahonas to come in, what would you tell him?
WALTER:  Well, I love free-enterprise capitalism.  I think it needs to be regulated.  I don't think it's fair to tar all of corporate America for what Enron did, even though there's a lot of that that goes on.  It's not the rule.
The problem is this monolithic view that people take, and, as much as I admire you, I do worry about your contributions to -- and I think the medium of television and mass media in general tilt this way -- towards keeping everything black and white, everything simple.
WALTER:  ..
and we have to live with the stress and the tension of...
All right.  Gentlemen, we appreciate you taking the time.
SCARBOROUGH, Maine –  A former U.S
Airways ticket agent who issued boarding passes to the terrorists who later hijacked a plane out of Boston on Sept.
11, 2001, says he felt guilty afterward.
Atta's demeanor, his angry-looking eyes and the pair's first-class, one-way tickets to Los Angeles made Tuohey think twice.
"I said to myself, 'If this guy doesn't look like an Arab terrorist, then nothing does.' Then I gave myself a mental slap, because in this day and age, it's not nice to say things like this," Tuohey told the Maine Sunday Telegram
"You've checked in hundreds of Arabs and Hindus and Sikhs, and you've never done that.
I felt kind of embarrassed."
A few hours later, Tuohey was blaming himself as he watched news reports of the attacks on the World Trade Center.
After leaving Portland on a 6 a.m
flight, Atta and Alomari landed in Boston, where they joined three other hijackers on American Airlines Flight 11 (search), which they crashed into one of the twin towers.
Five other hijackers left Boston around the same time and crashed United Airlines Flight 175 (search) into the other tower.
Tuohey, 58, said he felt at least partly responsible in the days following the attacks.
Law enforcement officials believe Atta, mastermind of the Sept.
11 attacks, started his day in Portland — about 100 miles from Boston — to avoid having all the hijackers arrive at once at Logan International Airport (search).
"It just sent chills through you.
You see his picture in the paper (now)," Tuohey said.
"You see more life in that picture than there is in flesh and blood."
After the attacks, Tuohey had a gut feeling the two men were involved.
After going home, he was called back to the airport to talk to an FBI agent and picked Atta and Alomari out on a security video without any doubt.
A few weeks later, another investigator came by Tuohey's house and showed him a large number of pictures and asked him to point out the men he had waited on that day.
"I went right to Atta," Tuohey said.
"It's like the skull on a poison bottle.
There's no mistaking that face."
The chairman of the federal commission investigating Sept.
11 (search) said Wednesday the terrorist attacks could have been prevented.
"As you read the report, you're going to have a pretty clear idea of what wasn't done and what should have been done," he told one television station.
The comments were the first by Kean, former Republican governor of New Jersey, blaming public officials for not anticipating the attacks.
"There are people that, certainly, if I was doing the job, who would certainly not be in the position they were in at the time because they failed," he said.
Kean didn't name names but it has previously been reported that the Bush administration received intelligence warnings that provided hints about Usama bin Laden's (search) intentions before Sept.
11.
