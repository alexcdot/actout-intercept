Using CASS tools to evaluate media bias on specific news topics
Ever since I learned about propaganda in grade eight English, I realized that the bias in the news holds one of the world’s best kept secret. Who really controls of the media? Curious to probe media bias, I decided to give myself and my activist peers an ability to investigate bias in the media in grade 11. With the help of some Ruby applets, I coded a software to automate web navigation, text scraping, and syntax analysis to calculate how biased a newspaper is to an entity like “Trump”, or “Dell”. For example, I wanted to investigate how the New York Times’ opinion of Dell changed after signing a long-term sponsorship deal with them. The program gathered dozens of NYT articles with an advanced Google search, removed grammatical words and isolated the nouns and adjectives. Finally, it ran a statistical analysis of the text and averaged the bootstrap test values to return an overall bias reading. To my surprise, I found the NYT to write 33% more positively of Dell after their sponsorship deal, and shared my software with the propaganda studies class at my school.
