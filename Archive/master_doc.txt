Just spoke with @PaulMGrod of UCC. Told him I'm sorry to have spoken lightly of the very real threat Russia poses to Ukraine.
  OTTAWA—While Justin Trudeau says he’s sorry for making light of the crisis in Ukraine, the Liberal leader says Canadians are “open” to politicians who take risks — and may have to apologize for the odd verbal gaffe.

  The Liberal leader spent much of Tuesday doing damage control for comments about the violent clashes in
  
    Ukraine
  
  , which have left dozens dead.

  In a tweet Tuesday, Trudeau said he had spoken with Paul Grod of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress and “told him
  
    I’m sorry to have spoken lightly
  
  of the very real threat Russia poses to Ukraine.”

  He followed that up with another Tweet saying, “We take the situation in Ukraine very seriously.”

  The Liberal leader also paid a visit to the Ukraine embassy in Ottawa to personally apologize to the ambassador, and sign a book of condolences.

  “I wanted to make sure that I had the chance to express directly to leaders within the Ukrainian community . . . and the ambassador himself how seriously the Liberal party takes the situation in Ukraine and to say that I regret my comments about Russia, which made light of some very real fears and concerns that Ukrainians have about Russian intervention,” Trudeau told reporters on Parliament Hill.

  But Trudeau, who has been criticized for previous comments about the Boston bombing and communist states, also said that Canadians appreciate politicians who speak out.

  “I’m confident that my values, my approach and my openness with Canadians is exactly what people from across the country are looking for.”

  Trudeau was asked what more Canada could do to help in the crisis that left more than 80 people dead as demonstrators clashed with police in Kyiv over the leadership of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.

  “Canada should do more . . . It is even more worrying now that Russia lost in hockey and will be in a bad mood. We fear some involvement of the Russian government in Ukraine,” Trudeau
  
    said
  
  on the program.

  Conservative and NDP MPs
  
    jumped
  
  on the remarks as further evidence that Trudeau lack’s judgment on critical foreign policy issues.

Trudeau linked the upheaval in Ukraine to Russia’s Olympic hockey woes.“If you look at the entire transcript, you’ll see that Justin Trudeau spoke very seriously about the situation in Ukraine, and anyone who’s been on Tout Le Monde En Parle knows what kind of show it is,” he said.“I fail to see the levity when you’ve got dozens of people being shot dead in the street of their own capital, so you don’t make jokes about that,” said NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair.In an interview that aired at the end of a big Olympic hockey weekend in which Canada won gold over Sweden, Trudeau was asked about the situation in Ukraine and the prospect of Russian involvement.He joked that Russia could be fuming after being eliminated last week from the Olympic medal round.“It’s very worrisome,” Trudeau said after telling the panel that he now considers Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to be illegitimate. “Especially since Russia lost in hockey, they will be in a bad mood. We are afraid of a Russian intervention in Ukraine.”“Only because of hockey?” the show’s host, Guy A. Lepage, asked Trudeau as other panelists chuckled.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

			SIMFEROPOL, UKRAINE—Russian troops took over Crimea as the parliament in Moscow gave President Vladimir Putin a green light Saturday to use the military to protect Russian interests in Ukraine.The newly installed government in Kyiv was powerless to react to the action by Russian troops based in the strategic region and more flown in, aided by pro-Russian Ukrainian groups.Tensions increased when Ukraine’s acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, made a late night announcement that he had ordered the country’s armed forces to be at full readiness because of the threat of “potential aggression.”Why Ukraine is not the Cold War revisited: BurmanIgnoring President Barack Obama’s warning Friday that “there will be costs” if Russia intervenes militarily, Putin sharply raised the stakes in the conflict over Ukraine’s future evoking memories of Cold War brinkmanship.After Russia’s parliament approved Putin’s motion, U.S. officials held a high-level meeting at the White House to review Russia’s military moves in Ukraine. U.S. President Barack Obama also spoke with Putin by telephone.“Vladimir Putin emphasized that, in the case of a further spread in violence in eastern regions and Crimea, Russia maintains the right to protect its interests and the Russian-speaking population that lives there,” the statement on the website said.Ukraine’s Ambassador to the UN Yuriy Sergeyev asked the Security Council “to do everything possible now” to stop what he called Russian “aggression.” Russia’s UN ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, said the government in Kyiv needs to get away from “radicals” and warned, “such actions they’re taking could lead to very difficult developments, which the Russian Federation is trying to avoid.” He said Russia was intervening at the request of pro-Russian authorities in the autonomous Crimea region that is part of Ukraine.Calling the situation in Ukraine “as dangerous as it is destabilizing,” U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power said, “It is time for the Russian military intervention in Ukraine to end.” She warned that “Russia’s provocative actions could easily push the situation beyond the breaking point.” She asked that Russia directly engage the Ukraine government and called for international monitors to be sent to Ukraine to observe the situation.“Russia and the West find themselves on the brink of a confrontation far worse than in 2008 over Georgia,” Dmitri Trenin, the director of Carnegie Moscow Center, said in a commentary posted on its website. In Georgia, Russian troops quickly routed the Georgian military after they tried to regain control over the separatist province of South Ossetia that has close ties with Moscow.The latest moves followed days of scripted, bloodless turmoil on the peninsula, the scene of centuries of wars and seen by Moscow as a crown jewel of the Russian and Soviet empires. What began Thursday with the early-morning takeover of the regional parliament building by mysterious troops continued Saturday afternoon as dozens of those soldiers — almost certainly Russian — moved into the streets around the parliamentary complex and seized control of regional airports, amid street protests by pro-Russian Crimeans calling for Moscow’s protection from the new government in Kyiv.That government came to power last week in the wake of months of pro-democracy protests against the now-fugitive president, Viktor Yanukovych, and his decision to turn Ukraine toward Russia, its longtime patron, instead of the European Union. Despite the calls for Moscow’s help, there has been no sign of ethnic Russians facing attacks in Crimea or elsewhere in Ukraine.Obama on Friday called on Russia to respect the independence and territory of Ukraine and not try to take advantage of its neighbour’s political upheaval.He said such action by Russia would represent a “profound interference” in matters he said should be decided by the Ukrainian people. He has not said, however, how the U.S. could pressure Moscow to step back from its intervention.On Friday, Ukraine accused Russia of a “military invasion and occupation” in the Crimea, where Russia’s Black Sea fleet is based. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk called on Moscow “to recall their forces, and to return them to their stations,” according to the Interfax news agency. “Russian partners, stop provoking civil and military resistance in Ukraine.”Ukraine’s population of 46 million is divided in loyalties between Russia and Europe, with much of western Ukraine advocating closer ties with the European Union while eastern and southern regions look to Russia for support. Crimea, a semi-autonomous region that Russia gave to Ukraine in the 1950s, is mainly Russian-speaking.In his address to parliament, Putin said the “extraordinary situation in Ukraine” was putting at risk the lives of Russian citizens and military personnel stationed at the Crimean naval base that Moscow has maintained since the Soviet collapse.Despite Putin’s sharp move, there were possible signs Saturday that the Russian leader could soften his approach. Former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was freed a week ago after more than 2½ years in prison, was reported to be heading to Moscow for a meeting with Putin on Monday. Putin has had good ties with Tymoshenko in the past, and he may look to her for a possible compromise.Putin’s parliamentary motion loosely refers to the “territory of Ukraine” rather than specifically to Crimea, raising the possibility that Moscow could use military force in other Russian-speaking areas in eastern and southern Ukraine, where many detest the new authorities in Kyiv.But in a note of restraint, Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said the motion doesn’t mean the president would immediately send additional troops to Ukraine. “There is no talk about it yet,” he said.Pro-Russian protests were reported Saturday in the eastern cities of Kharkiv, Donetsk and Luhansk and the southern port of Odesa. In Kharkiv, 97 people were injured in clashes between pro-Russia demonstrators who flushed supporters of the new Ukrainian government out of the regional government building and hoisted the Russian flag on top of it, according to the Interfax news agency.Trenin, of Moscow’s Carnegie office, said that Putin could be seeking to “include Crimea within the Russian Federation and eastern and southern regions of Ukraine forming a separate entity integrated with Russia economically and aligned with it politically.”“It is not clear at this point whether Kyiv will be left to build a rump Ukraine with the western regions or whether it will be swayed to join the eastern regions,” he wrote.In Crimea, the new pro-Russian prime minister — who came to power after the gunmen swept into parliament on Thursday — claimed control of the military and police and asked Putin for help in keeping peace. There was no visible presence of Ukrainian troops Saturday.Crimean Tatars, the historic hosts of the land who make up 12 per cent of the peninsula’s population and stand strongly for Crimea remaining part of Ukraine, didn’t put up any visible resistance Saturday.“The last two or three days have turned around the life of all the people in Crimea,” said Refat Chubarov, a Crimean Tatar leader. “They’ve taken over military bases and civil institutions. That’s why Crimean society is filled with fear. People are afraid of everyone and everything.”Crimea only became part of Ukraine in 1954 when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred jurisdiction from Russia, a move that was a mere formality when both Ukraine and Russia were part of the Soviet Union. The Soviet breakup in 1991 meant Crimea landed in an independent Ukraine.Russia put pressure on Ukraine from another direction when a spokesman for state gas company Gazprom said that Ukraine owed $1.59 billion in overdue bills for imported gas. Sergei Kuprianov said in a statement carried by Russian news wires that the gas arrears would endanger a recent discount granted by Russia.The Russian payment demand and loss of the discount would accelerate Ukraine’s financial crisis. The country is almost broke and seeking emergency credit from the International Monetary Fund.The tensions barely touched everyday life in Simferopol, the regional capital of Crimea, or anywhere on the peninsula. Children played on swings a few blocks from the parliament building, and most of the city’s stores were open. Couples walked hand-in-hand through parks. Crimea’s airports — civilian and military — were closed to air traffic, but trains and cars were moving to and from the Ukrainian mainland. The civilian airport in Simferopol was reopened late Saturday night.“Things are normal,” said Olga Saldovskaia, who was walking through town with her son and grandson. While she doesn’t like having gunmen in the streets, like many people in this overwhelmingly ethnic Russian city, she also found their presence reassuring.“If anyone tries to hurt the people here, they will protect us,” said Saldovskaia. She said she sympathized with the pro-democracy protesters in Kyiv, but also worries that turmoil in the capital could lead to violence against ethnic Russians. She added, though, that she definitely doesn’t want Crimea to become part of Russia.Moscow has remained silent on claims that Russian troops are already in control of much of the peninsula, saying any troop movements are within agreed-upon rules governing the semi-autonomous Ukrainian region.Meanwhile, flights remained halted at Simferopol’s airport. Dozens of armed men in military uniforms without markings patrolled the area. They didn’t stop or search people leaving or entering the airport, and refused to talk to journalists.AP journalists crossing into Crimea from mainland Ukraine were briefly stopped at a checkpoint manned by troops in unmarked camouflage uniforms as well as officers in uniforms of the Berkut, the feared riot police that cracked down on anti-Yanukovych protesters before he fled the capital a week ago.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…PARIS—The United States and Russia agreed Sunday that the crisis in Ukraine requires a diplomatic resolution, but four hours of talks between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov failed to break a tense East-West deadlock over how to proceed.Sitting face to face but not seeing eye to eye on any of the most critical issues, Kerry and Lavrov advanced far different proposals on how to calm tensions and de-escalate the situation, particularly as Russia continues to mass troops along its border with the former Soviet republic. As he called for Moscow to begin an immediate pullback of the troops, Kerry also ruled out discussion of Russia’s demand for Ukraine to become a loose federation until, and unless, Ukrainians are at the table.“The Russian troop buildup is creating a climate of fear and intimidation in Ukraine,” Kerry told reporters at the home of the U.S. ambassador to France after the meeting, which was held at the Russian ambassador’s residence. “It certainly does not create the climate that we need for dialogue.”The U.S. believes the massing of tens of thousands of Russian soldiers along the border, purportedly for military exercises, is at once an attempt to intimidate Ukraine’s new leaders after Russia’s annexation of the strategic Crimean peninsula and to use a bargaining chip with the United States and the European Union, which have condemned Crimea’s absorption into Russia and imposed sanctions on senior Russian officials.U.S. officials said Kerry proposed a number of ideas on troop withdrawals from the border and that Lavrov, while making no promises, told him he would present the proposals to the Kremlin.At a separate news conference at the Russian ambassador’s house, Lavrov did not address the troop issue. Instead he made the case for Moscow’s idea of Ukraine as a federalized nation with its various regions enjoying major autonomy from the government in Kyiv. Russia says it is particularly concerned about the treatment of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers who live in southern and eastern Ukraine.He said every time Ukraine has elected a new president, the country has adopted a new constitution, proving that “the model of a unified state doesn’t work.”Ukrainian officials are wary of decentralizing power, fearing that pro-Russia regions would hamper its Western aspirations and potentially split the country apart. However, they are exploring political reforms that could grant more authority to local governments.The U.S. has been coy about its position on a federation, but officials insist that any changes to Ukraine’s governing structure must be acceptable to the Ukrainians.Kerry said the federation idea had not been discussed in any serious way during his meeting with Lavrov “because it would have been inappropriate to do so without Ukrainian input.”“Federation does not mean, as some in Kyiv fear, an attempt to split Ukraine,” he said. “To the contrary, federation … answers the interests of all regions of Ukraine.”We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

  When the Soviet Union collapsed 22 years ago, Ukraine was the first state to declare independence, shocking Russia when 90 per cent expressed support for cutting ties with its former ruler.

  But the country that Vladimir Lenin once described as “Russia’s first colony” is still trying to sever the cord that binds it to Moscow. More than 300,000 people have turned out in recent days for national protests against President
  
    Viktor Yanukovych’s decision to reject a European Union treaty
  
  for a customs union with Russia.

  Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, called the protests “more of a pogrom than a revolution,” describing them as an attempt to “shake the legitimate authorities” in advance of a 2015 presidential election.

  In spite of the swelling protests — and a series of defections from Yanukovych’s party — polls show opinion is sharply divided over whether Ukraine should cut itself off from Russia (on which it depends for trade and energy supplies) or and pursue a European partnership that is far from guaranteed.

  Nevertheless, there are historic as well as economic roots to the aversion that at least half the population feels to Russia’s bear hug.

  Although Ukrainians and Russians sprang from the same ethnic and Orthodox religious background (and early Russia was once ruled from Kyiv), differences grew over the centuries as power gravitated to Moscow. Ukrainians developed their own language and culture and, as Russian settlers colonized their country, resented being called “Little Russians.”

  By the mid-19th century, anger had grown.

  “For the last 150 years Russia has been viewed as the primary problem for Ukraine,” says Alexander Motyl, a political science professor at Rutgers University-Newark. “First it was a czarist empire, then a communist empire. There was collectivization (of agriculture), the great famine and crackdowns on language and culture.”

  But, Motyl adds, the main problem has not been resentment of Russians but resentment of a political system that has imposed hardship and humiliation on Ukraine with few rewards in return.

  “Younger, well-educated people in bigger cities, and western Ukraine, definitely want to be closer to Europe,” says Piotr Dutkiewicz of Carleton University in an interview from Moscow. “Some older people, including intellectuals, are against the EU for several reasons.”

  And the “basic economic calculation” looks bad, Dutkiewicz says.

  Trade with the EU would be a $1-billion gain for Ukraine, with an additional $900 million offered in aid. That pales by comparison with the $8 billion or more Ukraine could gain from a closer union with Russia.

  But Putin’s two-fisted approach to Ukraine’s EU decision may have prompted a harder pushback than he or Yanukovych imagined, says Paul Goble, a retired U.S. State Department expert on the non-Russians of the former Soviet Union.

  “Putin has overplayed his hand,” Goble said. “He’s not only alienated Ukrainians but woken up some people in the West to the fact that he’s a dangerous man who doesn’t respect the sovereignty of his neighbours.”

  “The Russian Federation could be significantly smaller in the next 10 years,” he said. “When you look at the population, 40 per cent of Russian males are now Muslim. There is a massive (guest worker) influx from Central Asia. Putin is playing on the most xenophobic fears of Russians.”

  Instead of cultivating a neighbourly relationship with fellow Slavic nation Ukraine, Putin has gone for the political jugular. “If Ukraine becomes part of Europe, a fundamental reordering of society could happen. He’s afraid of that.”

  “I’ve been watching Ukraine for 40 years, and this is a very big deal. It’s bigger than the Orange Revolution.”

      
        Correction -December 4, 2013:
      
      This article was edited from a previous version that misstated the percentage of Muslim Russian males.

  SLAVYANSK, UKRAINE—We were just a few nervous steps from the taxi when the small mob descended.

  Four angry faces, bulged tight with tension on the ready-to-blow streets of Slavyansk, getting right up in ours. Three men and a woman. Fifty-something. Friends of Russia.
  
    Civilians
  
  .

  But there was no hiding the other dirty word: journalist. And so, with great reluctance, I played the Toronto Star card.

  A frenzy ensued. And amid the shouts, and Mikhail’s counter-shouts, I saw the most aggressive of the men raise his cellphone to make The Call. He was a civilian, but it seemed now that he knew someone who was not. We were about to get sucked down the black hole of detention that is taking reporters and others out of the regional equation at a torrid rate.

  One last card to play. “Parlez-vous Francais?” I asked in the calmest voice I could muster. “Je suis un journalist Canadien.
  
    Franco-Canadien
  
  .” Franco Franco Franco. I couldn’t say it enough. Anything but English.

  It was a ruse that probably shouldn’t have worked. But it slowed things down. The woman pulled down the arm of the man with the cellphone, buying us time.

  For the next 30 minutes we withstood a withering browbeat. It was The World According to Putin — a fierce, beseeching laundry list of grievances, frustrations and fear, delivered in staccato Russian.

  But the more they vented, the less angry they became. And about halfway through, I began to think — hope —
  
    vive le Quebec libre
  
  . My dismal command of Canada’s other official language was enough to persuade these desperate and panicked monolingual Russians in
  
    Ukraine
  
  that we weren’t really the enemy. French, ironically, was our Get Out Of Jail card in a part of Ukraine whose language lacks official status with the new government in Kyiv.

  This complex mess involves much more than language. But as we worked to extract ourselves — there were least 20 handshakes in the final 15 minutes of the encounter, and one of the men actually said “sorry” at the very end — the risk of speaking English in these parts was never more apparent.

  The airwaves have been stripped of Ukrainian television and there are Moscow’s state-controlled feeds in their place. And for the past week, leaflets have been circulating throughout the insurgent-controlled towns warning of American provocateurs. “Beware the CIA in sheep’s clothing,” one reads.

  Thursday afternoon’s close call came on a day that got more jagged by the hour in Slavyansk, the tactical epicentre of Ukraine’s separatist uprising. The morning saw Ukrainian special forces advance in two columns to within three kilometres of the city centre,
  
    unloading fire on pro-Russian checkpoints
  
  that left at least three dead.

  As insurgents retreated under clouds of flaming tire smoke and as news of the deaths spread, the Ukrainian army then retreated, leaving a numbed city to at least superficially go about its business.

  Reaction to the violence was swift, with Moscow signalling an intensification of military exercises on along the Ukrainian border and Russian President Vladimir Putin issuing a warning of “consequences.”

  Inside the city, the thin veneer of business-as-normal was transparent. The Star spoke to a group of three young men, longtime friends we were told, near the Slavyansk train station who seemed cautiously at odds with each other.

  They all shared anger and frustration at the morning’s deaths — and a fear that their city was beginning to buckle. One said it was a big mistake for the Ukrainian army to confront pro-Russian checkpoints as they are overwhelmingly manned by local volunteers — unlike “others, who may not all be Ukrainian,” who are inside city buildings.

  The odd man out was Alexander, 30 (he declined to give his last name, saying only “nyet, nyet”). He began expressing a preference for “one Ukraine, like it was before,” when the other two deliberately drowned out his answer, talking over him.

  Moments later, as the three walked away, there was an astonishing sight — the sky suddenly appeared filled with confetti.

  As the white dots drew nearer, they shaped up to be thousands of leaflets airdropped by the government in Kyiv as a “Survival Guide” to the people of Slavyansk.

  “Don’t come near government buildings,” the one-pager warned. “First you will be a human shield, then you will be a hostage. For Russian terrorists, the more victims the better.”

  It was in the mercurial aftermath of the landing leaflets that the Star found itself accosted Thursday.

  Later, upon finding safe haven for the night, came the lone great news of the day: the
  
    release of Vice News journalist Simon Ostrovosky
  
  after four days in the custody of the separatists. He left Slavyansk in a CBC van.

  Ostrovosky told CBC he had been held with some 10 other local journalists, who remain in custody. He was “beaten and blindfolded at the start of his ordeal” but treatment improved as the days wore on.

				Stepan Bandera, who led a Ukrainian insurgent army during the Second World War, is seen as a hero in western Ukraine and a villain to Russians.
			KYIV, UKRAINE—The rhetoric out of Moscow is consistent, bombastic and, to the western ear, perhaps a bit puzzling: Ukraine today is run by thugs, fascists and Banderists.To Russians and ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine, Bandera is a villain, a vile betrayer who allied himself with Adolf Hitler in the worst years of the Second World War.Bandera’s story — or, experts say, more correctly his myth — is powerful. Russian President Vladimir Putin referenced Bandera twice — calling him “Hitler’s accomplice” — during his speech to the Russian Parliament calling for the annexation of Crimea. And he and his administration have repeated the reference since to describe Ukraine.Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk was forced to reassure his own skeptical populous in the restive east and south, the Washington Post reports. Speaking in Russian on national television, he pledged that “supporters of Bandera” would not pour into eastern and southern cities and towns on a quest to “re-educate” the population.Meanwhile, at Maidan, Kyiv’s Independence Square, Bandera’s image is displayed as an inspiration, sharing space only with poet Taras Shevchenko, considered the father of the Ukrainian language. Ukrainians have even started answering their phones with the Bandera phrase “Glory to Ukraine” rather than the more traditional “Hello.”He and his Ukrainian insurgent army, depending on the point of view, fought with Hitler or fought against Hitler. He betrayed the Soviet Union or tried to save Ukraine from Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. He slaughtered Poles, or, well, everyone acknowledges he killed Poles, though Ukrainians would say it was part of their fight for independence. Nevertheless, Poles share Russia’s distaste for Bandera, whom the Soviet KGB killed in 1959, when he was living in West Germany.Former president Viktor Yushchenko, the pro-West leader of the 2004 Orange Revolution, posthumously named Bandera “Hero of Ukraine.”Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-Russia president who succeeded Yushchenko and whose flight to Russia in February presaged the showdown in Crimea, revoked the honour.“He wanted to create a Greater Ukraine reaching from the river Danube to the Caspian Sea,” Per Anders Rudling, an expert on Ukrainian history at Sweden’s Lund University, told the Washington Post. “He and his followers, similarly to the Nazis, advocated selective breeding to create ‘pure’ Ukrainians.”But the historians also say it didn’t last long, and Bandera ended up in the Nazis’ Sachsenhausen concentration camp near Berlin, while two of his brothers died in Auschwitz.And, they note, as soon as Hitler’s forces invaded Ukraine, the pledge by Bandera’s men to “fight the occupier” applied to the Nazis.But beyond the reality of Bandera is the myth — and what he represents. Historians and analysts in Ukraine think that by attacking Bandera, Putin isn’t attacking simply a man reviled by Stalin but also the broader notion of Ukrainian independence.“The real issue here is that Russians do not and never have accepted that Ukraine is a real country,” said Stanislav Kulchytsky, the head of the department of Ukrainian history at the country’s National Academy of Sciences. “Poles have Poland, Germans have Germany, Turks have Turkey. But in the Russian view, Ukrainians are really Russian. It’s an imperialist view, and it isn’t going away.”Bandera, in particular, troubles Putin, who’s known to be a student of Stalin. The Germans released Bandera in September 1944 and provided his men with weapons in hopes they would blunt the advance of the Red Army. Obviously, that failed.At the end of the war, Bandera remained in Germany, promoting Ukrainian independence until 1959, when he was found dead in his apartment in Munich of cyanide poisoning. A German court convicted a KGB defector of the crime three years later, finding the hit had been ordered by then-Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.Volodymyr Viatrovych, the director of the Center for Research of the Liberation Movement in Lviv and a leader of the protest movement at Maidan, said the Bandera image works for Putin in the world outside Russia because of the connection to fascism.

				To Stephen Harper — with Vadym Prystaiko, the Ukrainian ambassador to Canada — some regimes are simply and unequivocally evil, writes Thomas Walkom.
			Throughout the Ukrainian crisis, Prime Minister Stephen Harper has been uncompromising.His government was one of the first to support the street protesters who eventually overthrew Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych.His visit to Kyiv later this week will be the first by any G7 leader.Given that some 20-million Russian and other Soviet citizens died in the war against Nazism, it wasn’t the most politic of comments.Even the U.S. government hasn’t been as bellicose.American Secretary of State John Kerry says the U.S. recognizes Russia’s “legitimate interests in Ukraine.”That sentiment has been echoed by former U.S. national security advisers Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, both of whom are calling for the Finlandization of Ukraine as a way to solve the crisis.Simply put, that means that Ukraine, like Finland, would forge economic relations with the West but would not join NATO.Meanwhile, European Union leaders have been trying to find a pathway through the Ukrainian minefield that expresses their dismay at Russian actions, while leaving the door open to an eventual resolution.What’s more, there is little economic downside from talking tough to Moscow. A report prepared by the Library of Parliament notes that Russia accounts for less than half a percentage point of Canada’s total world trade.Harper got the message and has kept his mouth shut about Chinese human rights abuses ever since. He faces no such constraint where Russia is concerned.But in part, Harper’s tough line on Ukraine reflects a long-held view on what he sees as morality in foreign affairs. Conservative politicians, he said back in 2003, should not just bend with the winds of convenience. Instead, they should take into account “moral insights on right and wrong.”Harper also supports the current military-backed regime in Egypt even though it came to power in a coup that removed the country’s democratically elected president.To Stephen Harper, some regimes are simply and unequivocally evil. In his mind, it seems, Putin’s is one of those. Russia is so offside that Harper last year questioned its membership in the G8 group of nations — what he called the “G7 plus one.”We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				Ukraine supporters yell at pro-Russian protesters during a rally in Simferopol, Ukraine, on March 10. Crimean citizens will vote in a referendum on March 16, on whether to become part of the Russian federation.***
			Russian forces have effectively taken control of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in what has turned into Europe’s greatest geopolitical crisis since the end of the Cold War. On Sunday the region is to hold a referendum on whether to split off and become part of Russia, which the West says it will not recognize.“We have to admit that our life now is almost like . . . a war,” Foreign Minister Andrii Deshchytsya said before meeting his counterparts from Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. “We have to cope with an aggression that we do not understand.”Deshchytsya said Ukraine is counting on help from the West. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk is to meet with U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington on Wednesday.On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said lawlessness “now rules in eastern regions of Ukraine as a result of the actions of fighters of the so-called ‘Right Sector,’ with the full connivance” of Ukraine’s new authorities.Right Sector is a grouping of several far-right and nationalist factions whose activists were among the most radical and confrontational of the three-month-long demonstrations in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, which eventually ousted President Viktor Yanukovych.The Kremlin statement also claimed Russian citizens trying to enter Ukraine have been turned back at the border by Ukrainian officials.Obama has warned that the referendum in Crimea would violate international law. But on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin made it clear that he supports the vote, in phone calls with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Minister David Cameron.“The steps taken by the legitimate leadership of Crimea are based on the norms of international law and aim to ensure the legal interests of the population of the peninsula,” said Putin, according to the Kremlin.On Monday, Putin was briefed by Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, on the contents of a document Lavrov received from Secretary of State John Kerry explaining the U.S. view of the situation in Ukraine.That document contains “a concept which does not quite agree with us because everything was stated in terms of allegedly having a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and in terms of accepting the fait accompli,” Lavrov said. The Kremlin contends Yanukovych was ousted by a coup.In Washington, the State Department said it was still waiting to hear from Moscow whether it would accept a U.S. proposal for negotiating an end to Ukraine crisis.A statement released Monday said Kerry, in weekend discussions with Lavrov, reiterated Washington’s demand that Moscow pull back its troops from Ukraine and end attempts to annex the Crimean peninsula. Kerry also called on Russia to cease what the statement described as “provocative steps” to allow diplomatic talks to continue.China has been studiously neutral since Ukraine crisis began and it remained unclear whether China would side with the U.S. and Europe or with Moscow.The UN Security Council, meanwhile, met on Ukraine for the fifth time in 10 days to hear closed-door briefings from UN political chief Jeffrey Feltman and Ukraine’s UN ambassador, Yuriy Sergeyev. The council has been unable to take any action because Russia has veto power.France’s UN ambassador, Gerard Araud, said the goal was to “send a message to the Russians . . . ‘No referendum, you have to respect the Ukrainian constitution and negotiate.’”Lara Jakes, Matthew Lee and Julie Pace in Washington, and Edith M.

				A Maidan protester stands guard in front of frescoes at the Mykhaylo Gold Domes cathedral in Kiev, on Feb. 26, 2014.
			
  Will the people who feel nostalgic for the Cold War please leave the room. As the dramatic events in
  
    Ukraine
  
  threaten to rewrite the early history of this 21st century, it is dangerous that a relic of the 20th century keeps being injected into the debate.

  This is a moment of great peril for Ukraine and its people. There is no certainty here of a happy ending, even though it is impossible not to be stirred by the crowds filling Kyiv’s Maidan square night after night. They are demanding what other democracies take for granted: the right to determine their own future.

  But it is also a moment of great challenge beyond
  
    Ukraine’s borders
  
  . Depending on how this crisis unfolds, it has potentially immense implications for Europe, for the United States and, of course, for Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.

  Russia’s role in this drama flows uniquely from its geography and its history. As Ukraine’s eastern neighbour, Russia shares a strategic border as well as a tortured history together as part of the former Soviet Union. What happens in Ukraine matters mightily to Moscow.

  But there is little patience for this sentiment among powerful political interests in the U.S. In response to President Barack Obama’s declaration that the U.S. is not engaged in a “Cold War chess game” with Russia over Ukraine’s future, there are increasing demands among American conservatives that the Obama administration take a tougher line against Moscow.

  The leading proponent is Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate in the 2008 election. Returning this week from a visit to Ukraine, he called Obama “the most naïve president in history” and urged that he warn Putin that “any interference in Ukraine would have the most serious repercussions.”

  But McCain’s comic book nostalgia for the rhetoric of the Cold War ignores the complexity of the Ukrainian story. There will be no easy way out of this stalemate and McCain, while in Ukraine, unwittingly highlighted one reason why.

  McCain was photographed addressing a rally in Kyiv. Standing prominently beside him was a smiling Oleh Tyahnybok, leader of the ultra-nationalist, pro-fascist Svoboda opposition political party. Tyahnybok once called for the liberation of Ukraine from the “Muscovite-Jewish mafia” and has described Nazi death camp guard John Demjanjuk as a hero “fighting for truth.”

  But so far, western leaders actually in power are showing restraint. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Ukraine should not be a battleground between “West versus East,” suggesting it is clearly in everyone’s interests to avoid the kind of escalation that could get out of control. But it will take skilful diplomacy on all sides.

  One idea this week, which received considerable attention, came from Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser to former U.S. president Jimmy Carter.
  
    Writing in the Financial Times
  
  , he argued that Ukraine cannot be part of any anti-Moscow alliance and he suggested that a “Finnish model” could work. Finland, north of Ukraine, is also a neighbour of Russia.

  Brzezinski wrote the U.S. could assure Putin it would work toward “a truly independent and territorially undivided Ukraine” that would follow Finland’s lead. Like Finland, Ukraine would become a “mutually respectful neighbour with wide-ranging economic relations with Russia and the (European Union).”

  This crisis is happening in a part of the world that is steeped in history, most recently a very troubled history. It was only 25 years ago that the Berlin Wall collapsed, triggering a series of events that led to the demise of the Soviet Union. This effectively ended the Cold War.

  But if we want to reach back to the 20th century for illuminating historical references, we should go back a full 100 years. It was in August 1914, when the horror of the First World War began. Leaders at the time “sleepwalked” to war, seemingly unaware that their actions, or inaction, have consequences.

  It is that tragic moment in the 20th century — not the Cold War — that should be in our minds as Ukraine’s dramatic journey continues.

He has the look of a leader who, at game’s end, is trying to burnish his legacy.Putin’s “aggressive, militaristic and imperialistic” activities in Europe, the prime minister said Monday at a deliberately-arranged photo opportunity, aren’t just wrong. They threaten the “peace and stability of the world.”Harper and Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird have already compared Putin’s annexation of Crimea to Hitler’s land grabs of the 1930s. The prime minister now seems to be positioning himself as the Winston Churchill of the modern age, the leader who recognizes Satan for what he is when others are willing to temporize.That Canada alone can do nothing to stop Russia is immaterial. The point is to be seen as prescient, to be on the right side of history.Indeed, in far too many cases Harper has ended up on the wrong, or at least the indeterminate, side of history.In government, he invested his prestige in an Afghan war that the Canadian public eventually tired of.He was one of the first to call for military action against Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Gadhafi was quickly defeated. But Libya remains a mess that few NATO leaders, including Harper, want to be reminded of.He went out of his way to scupper international action against climate change. Unfortunately for his legacy, he did so just as the practical effects of climate change — including summer droughts and vicious winter storms — were becoming obvious.His rock-hard support of Israel has endeared him to many Jewish voters in Canada. However, history’s verdict on Israel and the Palestinians has not yet been rendered.Harper’s domestic legacy is settled. He will be remembered as the prime minister who negotiated free trade deals with the European Union and South Korea. He refocused government attention on resources, particularly bitumen from Alberta. He made the most serious effort of any prime minister since Pierre Trudeau to wean Canada from its dependence on the U.S. market.He continued the work, started by Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin, of dismantling the welfare state. And he wisely abandoned his own ideological predilections in order to spend his way through the first years of the post-2008 slump.But leaders also want to be remembered for their actions on the international stage. Lester Pearson’s name will always be linked to United Nations peacekeeping. Brian Mulroney will be viewed by history as a leader who helped end apartheid in South Africa. Chrétien’s claim to fame as a statesman is based on his refusal to join the U.S. coalition of the willing against Saddam Hussein.Stephen Harper? If events turn out as he predicts, Canada’s 22nd prime minister will be seen as a prophet — as a leader who recognized evil in the world and urged international action to stop it. That, I suspect, is what he’s aiming for.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion. Readers are encouraged to flag comments that fail to meet the standards outlined in our

				 Paul Heinbecker, a former Canadian  ambassador to the UN, is highly critical of Ottawa's handling of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, and said he hopes Canada’s envoy returns to his post in Moscow within days.
			OTTAWA—The Harper government’s response to the Russia-Ukraine crisis smacks of empty gestures from a country that has become increasingly marginalized on the world stage, said two retired Canadian ambassadors Sunday.Those scathing reviews came from two of the county’s most distinguished ex-diplomats: Jeremy Kinsman, who has served as Canada’s senior envoy to Russia, Britain, Italy and the European Union, and Paul Heinbecker, the former ambassador to the United Nations and an adviser to past Conservative and Liberal prime ministers.They were highly critical of Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s decision Saturday to temporarily withdraw Canada’s ambassador to Russia, and of Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird for not ruling out the expulsion of Russia’s ambassador to Canada, Georgiy Mamedov, in a later televised interview.Both dismissed the Canadian response as “gestures” that underscored Canada’s lack of clout on the world stage, especially since its historic failure to win a temporary seat on the UN Security Council in 2010.“We are the great practitioners of grand gestures,” Kinsman said Sunday in a telephone interview from California.“Pulling your ambassador out for consultations — I happen to believe always you don’t do that. That’s strictly a gesture. This is the one time when you want your ambassador there.”Kinsman said that recalling Canada’s ambassador and suggesting the Russia’s envoy to Ottawa could be next is “silly” and that the government simply wants to be “seem to be doing something.”“That’s just childish,” he added. “Georgiy Mamedov is the dean of the diplomatic corps. He’s being there for 11 years; he’s been dealing with Canada for 30. He’s a professional.”“Mamedov is one of the guys you really want to be able to talk to,” Heinbecker said in an interview in Ottawa.“Mamedov was the guy who negotiated the end of the Kosovo war. He knows a little bit about how to cope with these kind of West-versus-Russia situations.”Heinbecker said he hopes Canada’s envoy returns to his post in Moscow within days and that the Harper government recognizes the need to keep its embassy there, and Russia’s in Ottawa, functioning at full strength.“It’s a government given to gestures. It’s foreign-policy by declaration and by gesture, all calculated with an eye on the next election,” Heinbecker said of Ottawa’s general response to the crisis.Fen Hampson, director of the global security at Waterloo, Ont.’s Centre for International Governance Innovation, defended the government’s decision as “a principled step in the right direction.” He also praised Baird for visiting protesters in Kyiv in December.Hampson said Canada should begin discussions with other G8 members about expelling Russia, “which was admitted on our watch at the Halifax summit” in 1995. He also said Canada has an influential role to play in NATO.“As a NATO member, we should also be pressing to beef up NATO forces in Central Europe and the Balkans while also ensuring in ongoing talks between NATO and Russia that the situation does not escalate or get out of hand,” he added.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				Independence Square in central Kyiv is the centre of the protests in Ukraine. An interactive map shows demonstrators where to find food, a toilet or shower, and even supplies needed by those who have barricaded themselves inside the square.
			
  When Ukrainian Canadian Krystina Waler first joined the Euromaidan protests in Kyiv’s Independence Square, she remembers the overwhelming feelings of hope among the crowd.

  It was late November. Waler turned toward the student standing next to her, he looked at her with tears in his eyes and said, “Yanukovych will have to do this; he has no choice but to sign the agreement.”

  That agreement was with the
  
    European Union
  
  regarding intentions to pursue freer trade, a move that would align the former Soviet bloc nation with the West and away from Russian influence. But President Viktor Yanukovych turned instead toward Moscow and accepted Russia’s $15-billion loan to ease Ukraine’s debt. The country erupted in anger. Russian President Vladimir Putin recently put the loan on hold until a new Ukrainian government is formed.

  In January, Waler joined the protests again, but the hope once felt by the thousands of Ukrainians now occupying the square had turned to dread and despair. Waler left just before police decided to clear the square using batons, bullets and physical might.

  Euromaidan, or “European square” was the name coined for the revolutionary movement after
  
    Yanukovych formally signalled he wouldn’t sign the EU-Ukraine agreement on Nov. 21
  
  . Word spread quickly throughout Ukraine via social media, and protests were organized under the hashtags #euromaidan, #євромайдан and #евромайдан according to the news website Global Voices. A
  
    Euromaidan Facebook
  
  page was also quickly set up.

  By Nov. 24,
  
    tens of thousands of people had descended into central Kyiv’s Independence Square
  
  and many have refused to leave until real reform is granted. Protesters have set up a mini city, fortified like a medieval town and centred around the main stage in the square.

  The Euromaidan demonstrators have learned from both social media and the
  
    Occupy movement
  
  (a protest against income inequality), how to digitally organize themselves. Using Facebook, Euromaidan has created an interactive map that provides detailed information on everything from where to grab a bowl of soup to the location of the nearest portable toilet.

  Euromaidan uses icons to pinpoint the location of makeshift hospitals, where to eat, information booths, bathrooms with showers, rest areas, churches and the barricades. Double click on an icon and a picture will pop up, along with a list of supplies needed at that particular station. For example, one hospital station says it needs water, sterile saline for flushing eyes after tear gas attacks, sterile wipes and lip balm. Click on a washroom icon and it will tell you it needs toilet paper along with a message reminding everyone of the “cultural” importance of good hygiene.

  The food is all free, prepared by legions of volunteers, and Kyiv restaurants donate their leftovers to the movement, says Waler.

  At night, when the temperature drops below freezing, protesters are moved to safe houses or apartments. “The people of Kyiv have opened up their homes because you can’t sleep outside in – 30 C,” Waler says.

  With no visible end in sight to the political crisis in Ukraine —
  
    Catherine Ashton, the EU’s foreign policy chief
  
  offered Wednesday to broker Ukrainian constitutional reform to pave the way for a new government — the push to provide humanitarian aid to the demonstrators is intensifying.

  A charitable effort organized by Polish priest Stefan
  
    Batruch
  
  collected 11 tons of food, warm clothing, sleeping bags and dressings. The donations were loaded into trucks in Poland and sent into Ukraine. While the shipment cleared customs into Ukraine, it was refused entry into Kyiv, according to Polskie Radio.

  Some Polish politicians and leaders of the former
  
    Solidarity
  
  movement have even travelled to Kyiv to join Ukrainians fighting for reform. The supplies were important but largely a symbolic gesture, Batruch told Polskie Radio.

  The supplies are now sitting in a warehouse. Diplomatic efforts to get the trucks moving are underway.

				Russian President Vladimir Putin's marathon press conference on Tuesday was  marked by whoppers, including that Russian troops in Crimea are not Russian, but the West should try to understand why the troops are there, Thomas Walkom writes.
			There are two things to keep in mind about the Ukrainian crisis.The first is that, rhetoric aside, there is little that the West can or will do to force Russian President Vladimir Putin’s troops out of Crimea.The second is that Russia’s view of what’s happening in Ukraine differs dramatically from the one commonly accepted here.If those who overthrew the old order in Kyiv are counting on the West to protect them militarily from Moscow, they are almost certainly doomed to disappointment.There has been talk of economic sanctions. But as both the West and Russia know, these would cut two ways.In the short run, Western Europe depends on Russian oil and natural gas. Russian rubles grease Britain’s important financial industry.As the BBC reported, British Prime Minister David Cameron has been warned by his own officials against imposing sanctions that could interfere with London’s role as a financial centre.The West could expel Russia from the G8 group of big industrial nations. But so what? Many countries, including China, get by perfectly well outside of the G8.Resolutions condemning Russia’s intervention in Ukraine’s Crimea region, such as the one passed unanimously in the Commons Monday, may make the participants feel virtuous. But they have no practical effect.Lost in the clamour is the fact that Russia has an entirely different take on what is happening in Ukraine.In the West, last month’s revolution is lauded as a victory of democracy over despotism. To Russia’s leaders, however, it was a Washington-backed putsch designed to draw a region long deemed essential to Moscow’s security into the enemy camp.U.S. President Barack Obama says Ukraine can both be a friend to the West and to Russia.But I suspect he was speaking close to the heart when he accused the U.S. and its friends of playing a crucial role in the “coup d’état” that brought Ukraine’s new government to power.“They sit there across the pond as if in a lab running all kinds of experiments on the rats,” Putin said.To Moscow, the decision to dig in now follows logically from what it sees as two decades of Western double-dealing.Canadians remember that the Berlin Wall came down in 1989. Russia remembers that, in return, the U.S. and its allies agreed to recognize Moscow’s vital interest in its own neighbourhood.Yet to Russia’s dismay, that pledge was soon broken as NATO welcomed 11 former Soviet satellites into its fold, including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.In 2003 and 2004, Western countries backed so-called colour revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine. In 2008, NATO agreed that both would eventually be allowed to join the military alliance.The West viewed all of this as the march of democracy. But Moscow saw it as hypocritical meddling.Russia knows that the U.S. accords itself the right to intervene militarily in the affairs of its neighbours. It has famously done so throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.Yet when Moscow does the same, it finds itself branded a pariah.Being lectured on international law by the country that illegally invaded Iraq almost certainly irks.In the real world, this is unlikely to happen. For this crisis to end, Kyiv and Moscow will have to reach some kind of political accommodation.Moral and financial support from the West may be cheering for Ukraine. But it won’t be enough.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion. Readers are encouraged to flag comments that fail to meet the standards outlined in our

				Ukrainian special forces keep watch from inside an armoured personnel carrier in the eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyansk.
			SLOVYANSK, UKRAINE—Russia's defence minister on Thursday announced new military exercises along the Ukrainian border just hours after Ukrainian troops killed at least two pro-Russia insurgents in eastern Ukraine.The clashes were the first since acting President Oleksandr Turchynov ordered the resumption Tuesday of military operations in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russia protesters and masked gunmen have seized government buildings in at least 10 cities and set up roadblocks.“If the Kyiv government is using the army against its own people this is clearly a grave crime,” Putin said.Later in the day, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu announced new military exercises in Russia's south and west in reaction to the mounting unrest in eastern Ukraine and NATO exercises in Poland.Russia already has tens of thousands of troops stationed in regions along its border with Ukraine. The latest Russian military exercises will involve ground troops in the south and the west and the air forces patrolling the border, Shoigu said.He also quoted unspecified sources saying that Kyiv has deployed more than 11,000 troops and 160 tanks against the pro-Russia insurgents which he put at less than 2,000 troops. There was no way to immediately verify those figures.The Ukrainian government and the West have accused Russia of directing and supporting the insurgents and worry that Putin would welcome a pretext for a military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Putin denies that any Russian agents are operating in Ukraine, but insists he has the right to intervene to protect the ethnic Russians who make up a sizeable minority in eastern Ukraine.Earlier in Tokyo, President Barack Obama accused Moscow of failing to live up to “the spirit or the letter” of a deal last week to ease tensions in eastern Ukraine. If that continues, Obama said, “there will be further consequences and we will ramp up further sanctions.”With no appetite in the U.S. for a military response, Obama is largely banking on Putin caving under a cascade of economic sanctions targeting his closest associates. But the success of that strategy also depends on European nations with closer financial ties to Moscow taking similar action, despite their concern about a boomerang effect on their own economies.“I understand that additional sanctions may not change Mr. Putin's calculus,” Obama said on a Tokyo visit. “How well they change his calculus in part depends on not only us applying sanctions but also the co-operation of other countries.”The Ukrainian Interior Ministry said military and special police forces killed “up to five terrorists” while destroying three checkpoints north of Slovyansk, a city 160 kilometres west of the Russian border that has emerged as the focus of the armed insurgency. One government member was injured, the statement said.Stella Khorosheva, a spokeswoman for the Slovyansk insurgents, said two pro-Russia fighters were killed at a checkpoint in the village of Khrestyshche, 10 kilometres north of the city. She said checks were being made at hospitals to see if there were other casualties.The situation was quiet in Slovyansk itself, but checkpoints inside the city were abandoned and it was unclear where the pro-Russia insurgents manning them had gone.Khorosheva later said the pro-Russian militia had regained control over the disputed checkpoints and the fighters were ready to repel any attack by government troops.“We will defend ourselves to our last drop of blood. We are ready to repeat Stalingrad,” she told The Associated Press, invoking the memory of the Soviet army's victory over German forces in 1942-43.At least 10 Ukrainian government armoured vehicles were seen on the road north of Slovyansk and two helicopters were circling over the area. Troops ordered residents in the area to keep away.Near the town of Makatikha, several kilometres north of Slovyansk, pro-Russia militia set fire to barricades of car tires in an apparent attempt to reduce the visibility from the air. An Associated Press reporter saw about two dozen militiamen manning checkpoints along the road earlier in the day.In the southeastern city of Mariupol, Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said his forces had cleared city hall of the pro-Russia protesters who had been occupying it for more than a week. He did not describe the operation. The Ukrainian city sits along the main road between Russia and Russia's newly annexed Black Sea peninsula of Crimea.Yulia Lasazan, a spokeswoman for Mariupol's police department, told The Associated Press about 30 masked men armed with baseball bats stormed the building in the dark early Thursday and started beating the protesters. Five people were taken to a hospital, she said.It was not clear why the protesters, some of whom were believed to be armed, did not offer resistance but called local police instead. Lasazan said the police were controlling Mariupol city hall's perimeter and were negotiating with the remaining protesters to leave.Ukraine is going through its biggest political crisis since the fall of Soviet Union, set off by months of anti-government protests that led to President Viktor Yanukovych's flight to Russia in February.Yanukovych's ouster sparked wide anger in his support base in Ukraine's east. The insurgents, who claim Ukraine's post-Yanukovych government consists of nationalists who will suppress the east, are demanding regional autonomy or even annexation by Russia.Ukraine and Russia reached a deal in Geneva last week to defuse the crisis, but pro-Russian insurgents in the east — and right-wing militants in Kyiv — have defied calls for all sides to disarm and to vacate the buildings they are occupying.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				  Terms and Conditions.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…The two dominant narratives on Ukraine are by now familiar. Vladimir Putin is using Soviet bully tactics to keep satellite states in line, including this weekend’s illegal and illegitimate referendum in Crimea. The other view is that the West had been encroaching too much into the Russian neighbourhood for him not to react, and that it is hypocritical of us to be condemning him when the United States and its allies often interfere in and wage war on nations, plus support secessions selectively, as in South Sudan and East Timor. Apropos the West’s inconsistencies, let’s look at our own prime minister’s.In 2003, Stephen Harper wanted Canada to join the American invasion of Iraq. In 2006, he backed the Israeli invasion of Lebanon as a “measured” move to protect its interests. In 2011, he was silent when Saudi Arabia marched tanks and troops into Bahrain to protect its interests. Last year, he backed France’s military intervention in its former colony of Mali. But Russia invading Crimea is akin to the 1938 Nazi annexation of part of Czechoslovakia.Harper wants Russia booted out of the G8 but he never suggested tossing Saudi Arabia out of the G20. He supports the Ukrainian popular revolt that toppled a corrupt president. But he did not back the popular revolt in Bahrain against an autocratic king, or the historic uprising in Egypt against the corrupt and brutal autocrat Hosni Mubarak. In fact, he backed the Egyptian army when it toppled the democratically elected president Mohammed Morsi last year. The coup restored “stability,” Harper said. That’s what Putin said, too, in embracing Egyptian strongman Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi. Putin is at least consistent — he has no use for democracy in either Egypt or Ukraine. Putin has blamed the Ukrainian crisis on anti-Semites. Harper has characterized the critics of his stance on Israel as anti-Semites, and called the critics of his policy on Afghanistan unpatriotic.Putin demonized the Kyiv protesters as Nazis. Harper often raises the spectre of the Nazis — besides saying that the Russian moves in Crimea are Nazi-like, he and his ministers describe those who do not fully stand with Israel and those who wish to negotiate with Iran as Nazi appeasers.This is not to equate Harper’s political posturing with Putin’s war propaganda. Nor to pretend that national interests do not force leaders into double standards. But his hypocrisy seems driven mostly by the Conservative party’s re-election manual — hijack selected foreign policy issues in the service of pleasing targeted ethnic groups. As valid as his criticisms of Russia’s outrageous actions have been, his pronouncements are clearly not designed to carve out a constructive role for Canada but rather tailored to elicit applause at home from Canadian Ukrainians — just as his piano-playing gig in Israel reduced the prime minister to an entertainer desperate to please his audience.Harper’s actions on Russia parallel his approach to Iran. He recalled the Canadian ambassador to Moscow, just as he closed our embassy in Tehran. Canada does not have much power over either Iran or Russia. What little difference we can make as a mid-level western power lies in being able to mediate between the U.S. and Europe, on the one hand, and the other parties, on the other. Abandon that, and you are left with the rhetoric of escalating adjectives and symbolic gestures — Ottawa “condemns,” “strongly condemns” and “condemns in the strongest terms” and pledges $200,000, whereas what Ukraine needs is $35 billion to get out from under Russian hegemony. The mess in Ukraine is partly the Ukrainians’ own doing.What the nation needed, especially after the highly hopeful 2004-05 pro-democracy Orange Revolution, was a Nelson Mandela to unite its two main factions, the largely Ukrainian northwest and the largely Russian-speaking southeast. What it got instead was a Morsi — in fact, three of them, Viktor Yushchenko, Viktor Yanukovych and Yulia Tymoshenko, each serving his or her own constituency and, indeed, fanning the divisions.It is not naive to think that Canada could have made a difference. As the first western country to recognize Ukraine in 1991, we could have advanced good governance, transparency and human rights — precisely what the pro-democracy forces in the Kyiv Maidan have been demanding for three months. Canada could have helped with sustained engagement from 1.2 million Canadian Ukrainians, the most influential Ukrainian diaspora in the world.Instead, Ottawa, under both Liberals and Conservatives, watched as Ukraine fell under the sway of one oligarch after another. Now the prime minister is shouting empty slogans from the sidelines.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

					OTTAWA—Russia’s ambassador to Canada says talk about the possibility of Russian troops invading Ukraine is nonsense.Georgiy Mamedov says it’s an insult to the intelligence of Canadians to even suggest that might happen in light of recent events in Kyiv.The comments came two days after the Harper government suggested that Canada could impose sanctions against Russia if it were to interfere in Ukraine.Immigration Minister Chris Alexander first raised the possibility of Canadian sanctions against Russia on Sunday in a televised interview.“Whoever discusses rumours about Russian military intervention in Ukraine is committing an insult to the intellect of the Canadian public, full stop.”“If lives and health of our compatriots are in danger, we won’t stay aside,” Slutsky said Tuesday at a meeting with activists in Simferopol, the regional capital of the Crimea. He refused to elaborate.Tensions between the West and Russia continue to run high after Ukrainian authorities replaced their Russian-leaning President Viktor Yanukovych.Shortly after Yanukovych fled the capital Friday, a warrant was issued for his arrest.Prime Minister Stephen Harper was expected to make a statement Tuesday updating Canada’s position on the unrest in Ukraine.He was also scheduled to meet with members of the Ukrainian-Canadian community.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

			MOSCOW—Russia’s President Vladimir Putin threatened Wednesday to start charging Ukraine in advance for vital gas supplies — a move that could sharply hurt his neighbour, which is already on the verge of bankruptcy.It is just the latest way Moscow is tightening the economic screws on Ukraine since its pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted from power in February after months of street protests.Chairing a meeting with government ministers in his suburban residence outside Moscow, Putin said asking for advance gas payments “corresponded with the contract” between Ukraine and Russia. Russia has already eliminated a gas discount it had given Ukraine, arguing it was tied to a lease for Russia’s Black Sea Fleet base in Crimea, a Ukrainian region that Russia annexed last month. Ukraine has promised the International Monetary Fund that it will cut energy subsidies to residents in exchange for a bailout loan of up to $14 billion — so gas prices were set to rise 50 per cent on May 1 even before the latest salvo from Putin.Speaking in Kyiv earlier, Ukrainian Energy Minister Yuri Prodan said Ukraine will pay for March deliveries of gas from Russia only after it reaches an agreement on the price. He rejected the new, much higher price that Gazprom announced earlier and said Ukraine has not pumped in any gas from Russia so far this month.Authorities in Kyiv also warned Wednesday that they are prepared to use force to clear several government buildings seized by pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country.Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said the standoff in Luhansk and the two neighbouring Russian-leaning regions of Donetsk and Kharkiv must be resolved within the next two days.“I want to repeat that there are two options: political settlement through negotiations and the use of force,” Avakov told reporters. “We are ready for both options.”As he spoke, anti-government protesters in Luhansk erected high barricades along a thoroughfare running in front of the security service premises.Protesters continued to occupy the headquarters of Ukraine’s Security Service in Luhansk, with hundreds of supporters camped outside and shouting “Putin! Putin!” overnight.The security agency had said the separatists inside the building, armed with explosives and other weapons, were threatening hostages inside. The hostages — 56 in all — were allowed to leave the building overnight, it said. Local police disputed that claim, however, saying there had been no hostages.Serhiy Tyhipko, a Ukrainian lawmaker associated with Yanukovych’s ousted government, urged the new authorities in Kyiv not to storm the building in Luhansk but rather negotiate a peaceful resolution. He said the protesters wanted Ukraine to turn into a federal state with broad regional autonomy, not for their region to secede.“The people are not bringing up the issue of breaking off from Ukraine and are not calling for the help of foreign countries,” Tyhipko said on his Facebook page.In the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, where protesters were still occupying another government building, regional governor Serhiy Taruta met with key activists to try to find a solution to the crisis.The Donetsk activists sounded optimistic after the talks, with leading figure Denis Bulishin hailing the opportunity for dialogue but stopping short of talking about any tangible results.The Ukrainian government and the U.S. have accused Moscow of fomenting the unrest as a pretext for another Russian military incursion similar to last month’s takeover of Crimea. Up to 40,000 Russian troops are massed along the Ukrainian border, according to NATO.The Russian Foreign Ministry hit back at the West on Wednesday, calling for the U.S. to stop using international organizations as a means of “exacerbating tensions surrounding Ukraine.”We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				A pro-Russian gunmen drives a car damaged in a firefight, outside the eastern Ukraine town of Slovyansk, on April 13, 2014.
			MOSCOW—The conflict between pro-Russian gunmen and Ukraine’s authorities turned bloody on Sunday, with one security service officer killed and reports of people wounded on both sides, as the struggle for the country’s east escalated one week after separatists began systematically occupying government buildings.Gunfire — the first reported between authorities and pro-Russian separatists in the east — erupted as Ukraine declared that it would deploy its armed forces in a “large-scale anti-terrorist operation” against the burgeoning revolt in the Donetsk region.“The blood of Ukrainian heroes has been shed in a war which the Russian Federation is waging against Ukraine,” President Oleksandr Turchynov said in a televised address to the nation Sunday evening. “The aggressor has not stopped and is continuing to sow disorder in the east of the country.”The armed assaults on government buildings in the eastern region, close to the Russian border, have alarmed not only leaders in Kyiv — who accuse Moscow of a co-ordinated campaign of aggression against Ukraine — but also those in the West. The attacks, officials said, were reminiscent of the shadowy invasion of the Crimean Peninsula, which resulted in its annexation by Russia last month.“It has all the telltale signs of what we saw in Crimea,” Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Sunday on ABC television. “It’s professional, it’s co-ordinated, there’s nothing grassroots-seeming about it.”If the attacks continued, she warned, the United States would intensify its sanctions against Russia. As for the Kyiv government, it lost Crimea without firing a shot and has vowed not to repeat the mistake in eastern Ukraine.The West has been cautioning Ukraine against starting a shooting war with the separatists for fear that it would offer Russia, which has thousands of troops gathered across the border, a pretext for invasion. Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said, however, that he had no alternative but to begin an “anti-terrorist” campaign Sunday after days of urging the separatists to go home peacefully.Turchynov gave the separatists a deadline of 9 a.m. Monday to vacate the buildings and leave under an amnesty. Last week, they were given a deadline of Friday to do the same. The offer was ignored.Russia’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement Sunday night calling Ukraine’s actions “criminal” and adding that “it is now the West’s responsibility to prevent civil war in Ukraine.” The UN Security Council called an emergency meeting Sunday night, at Russia’s request, to discuss the mounting crisis.On Sunday night, there was little evidence that Russian supporters had any inclination to retreat. Last Monday, they overran the Donetsk regional administration building and have held it ever since. On Saturday, they took the Donetsk regional police headquarters, while men in camouflage overwhelmed the police department in Slavyansk, a town 90 kilometres from the city of Donetsk. By Sunday, they had stormed other towns in the region.Even so, there are objections in some quarters to the invasion and the Russian news media’s coverage, which has portrayed Ukraine’s Russian speakers as under threat and in need of protection. Moscow considers the Kyiv government illegitimate, and the Russian news media routinely call it a “fascist junta” in the pay of the United States.Trouble roiled one town after another in eastern Ukraine over the weekend. The police station, city council and prosecutor’s office in Yenakiev, 60 kilometres east of Donetsk, were seized Sunday. Former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, who has been accused of helping Moscow stir up unrest, comes from the town.Yanukovych fled to Russia in February after three months of protests against his government, set off by his refusal to sign an agreement for closer co-operation with the European Union. Instead, he wanted to pursue economic ties with Russia, an inclination more popular in the Russian-speaking east than in the rest of Ukraine.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				  Terms and Conditions.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…KYIV, UKAINE—With an ominous Russian threat gathering on its doorstep, Ukraine met with yet another astonishing sight Wednesday night — the desperate public unveiling of its new provisional government in the wintry open air of Independence Square, the very heart of its fragile revolution.In a scene that highlights where power lies — in the hands of the tens of thousands of protesters who occupy the battle-scarred Maidan — Ukraine’s temporary leadership emerged cap in hand to propose a new cabinet to carry the country through crisis until new elections in May.The names of more than 20 new cabinet ministers were greeted alternately with jeers and cheers as they were read aloud from the main stage. And the most important name of all was also the least likely — the nomination for temporary prime minister fell to Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who just days ago called the job “political suicide” given the soaring expectations of the street and the stark reality of a former Soviet republic facing financial, and possibly territorial, collapse.Yatsenyuk, 39, is a former Ukrainian foreign minister who favours ties with Europe. But he has also been among the most outspoken firebrands on the Maidan, urging the mass protests onward through unrest that ultimately toppled the regime of Viktor Yanukovych, who is now a fugitive on the run.The gesture of asking, rather than telling, the new Ukraine what comes next was underscored by the fact that none of this is yet official. But with the country on the verge of financial default and any bailout contingent upon the formation of a temporary government, the approval of Parliament seemed assured.The drama in the Maidan played out as the teeming square flickered under the light of thousands of candles, burning onward in the memory of the 78 protesters killed last week in the infamous bloodbath that ended the Yanukovych era.And it came not a moment too soon, capping a day that saw new geopolitical storm clouds gathering to the east as Russia announced the mobilization of thousands of troops along its volatile border with Ukraine.Russian defence officials described the mobilization as a routine military readiness drill. But the move piqued anxieties throughout Ukraine, Europe and the United States. Tensions in Ukraine’s Russian-dominated Crimean peninsula, meanwhile, flared as rival demonstrations clashed in the regional capital of Simferopol. An estimated 10,000 Crimean Tatars, a Muslim ethnic minority expelled during the Soviet era only later to return, chanted pro-Ukraine slogans. But as nearby gathering of pro-Russian activists swelled, a melee ensued, leaving several Russian demonstrators seriously injured and one man dead from an apparent heart attack, The Guardian reported.Anxieties extended also to Crimean port city of Sevastopol, where a self-appointed pro-Russia militia cordoned off the main road late Wednesday, stopping cars in search of “radicals,” ABC News reported. Though the city, like the rest of Crimea, is a semi-autonomous part of Ukraine, Sevastopol is also home to a significant Soviet-era Russian naval base that continues to operate under a lease agreement.How Ukraine will contend with all these precarious pieces depends largely on the goodwill of the thousands encamped on the Maidan. And despite this transformative events of the past week, the bitter memory of 2004’s failed Orange Revolution all but guarantees they will not budge anytime soon. “They toppled the government, they won freedom for the political prisoners, new elections have been called and the people responsible for last week’s killings are under investigation — so what else do you want?” said Mychailo Wynnyckyj, an associate professor of sociology at Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.“Well guess what, the people aren’t going away. They see themselves as the accountability force that will guarantee there really is a political reset. They will stay. And hey, the hardest part is behind them. Now it gets warmer. And nobody is shooting right now.”In recent days, the already complex public spectacle in central Kyiv has slowly begun to shift with developments. Having already achieved so many of its goals — and with the prospects for formalized political power through upcoming elections now dangling in front of the many factions involved — the Maidan is rife with soapbox oratory.And in contrast to the pat east-versus-west, Ukraine-versus-Russia framework that is so tempting to append to the Ukraine story, the speakers sharing the centre of the capital span the country’s entire political, geographic and social spectra.Yet the main thrust of their motivations now converge broadly upon the same themes, according to Ukrainian analyst Anton Symkovych, who is studying the phenomenon from afar as a visiting scholar at University of Edinburgh School of Law.“It is clear that most fight not for some ambiguous and contestable notion of a ‘national-liberation revolution,’ but for a constellation of causes: from the dismantling of a police state to European integration, from making Ukraine more just and less corrupt to a total political reload — and the removal of old-school politicians, both those recently in office and those in the opposition,” Symkovych wrote in an email to The Star.And, as evidenced by the interim leadership’s move Wednesday to go directly to the people to validate its plan for what come next, the Maidan will continue to be heard. In short, Ukraine wants to be served, not ruled.“What Ukrainians are showing at the Maidan is they want control structures, they want accountability,” said Wynnyckyj. “The generation in power over the past 20 years, with very few exceptions, doesn’t get that. They were all raised in an era where there is an elite that rules. What Ukrainians are showing now is they don’t want to be ruled. They want to represented.”We value respectful and thoughtful discussion. Readers are encouraged to flag comments that fail to meet the standards outlined in our

We have to LET OUR FEELINGS get out from our bodies!

BELIEVE ME...you need to feel the fountain of emotions that rages inside me!!!... more about Sveta from KievForeign policy has two legitimate functions: to advance a country’s interests and/or to change the world. A country that uses foreign policy primarily to talk to itself engages in the basest form of the art: it misleads its own people into thinking they are improving the world just as key national interests are being compromised.In the matter of Ukraine, where there are no angels, we in Canada have been unique among the nations in convincing ourselves that we are on the right side of history in near-complete abstraction from Ukraine’s deteriorating realities and at the expense of critical long-term Canadian interests.To see how this can be so, I would urge readers to consult the Facebook page of our minister of foreign affairs. Facebook and Twitter are instructive because they are apparently where Canada does much of its important foreign policy these days. Having made devastating cuts to our real, already modest international affairs infrastructure, we have correspondingly glorified the import of virtual media in solving the world’s great problems.On Feb. 21 of this year — a pivotal date in the crisis — the minister declared on Facebook: “Canada welcomes the agreement reached today between the Ukrainian government and opposition leaders. We will remain vigilant in monitoring progress under the agreement and stand ready to promote the full implementation of its commitments.” This was an agreement between the now ousted president Viktor Yanukovych and Ukraine’s leading opposition leaders, witnessed by France, Germany, Poland and Russia, to hold presidential elections by December of this year, reinstate the 2004 constitution and, among other things, address the problem of illegal weapons on the Maidan. Yanukovych was overthrown within 24 hours of that agreement. We would never mention the agreement again. On the contrary, within a week, on Feb. 27, the minister declared on Facebook: “I welcome the appointment of a new government today in Ukraine ... [T]he appointment of a legitimate government is a vital step forward in restoring democracy and normalcy to Ukraine.”If the minister declared the government legitimate, then might we safely presume it was installed according to Ukraine’s constitution? Alas, it was not: impeachment or replacement of the president requires the procedures and conditions articulated in articles 108 to 112 of the Ukrainian constitution. These were not followed, on any serious analysis.And so we have ignored the breach of a central agreement in Ukrainian governance and arrogated unqualified legitimacy on a government of dubious constitutionality.Who was central to the breach of the agreement and overthrow of Ukraine’s president? Answer: Pravy Sektor, the well-armed, organized and highly motivated Ukrainian militia that was pivotal to the escalation of the protests against the incompetent Yanukovych government. A scan of the minister’s Facebook page shows not a word about Pravy Sektor or any militia involvement in the Ukrainian revolution. Indeed, a survey of the tweets of leading Canadian political actors shows similar silence about Pravy Sektor. There is almost nothing written about this militia in any of the leading Canadian media sources, English and French alike.Last week, Pravy Sektor surrounded the Ukrainian parliament to demand the resignation of the new minister of the interior. The minister bravely refused to resign. In Canada, again, incuriosity and silence. But let there be no illusions: Pravy Sektor delivered the revolution, opportunistically capitalizing on the frustrations of thousands of regular Ukrainians. The militia is not beholden to the new Ukrainian government, and may again turn on it. It will not be assimilated easily into mainstream institutions. In the meantime, a clear majority of Ukraine’s population is rightly skeptical of the legitimacy and quality of the new government, and very cognizant of the inability of the new governors to control the militias that brought them to power.In illegally annexing Crimea, Russia, which knows Ukraine far better than any other country, has not been naive to any of these dynamics. Yet we continue to insist that we and the new Ukrainian government are somehow on the side of the angels — all in the name of the Ukrainian people. This Ukrainian government must be shocked at its good fortune in finding in us today a country that, on matters international, is really mostly interested in its own self-esteem.The wonderful people of Ukraine are not holding their breath. They deal in bald realities, not morality plays. The people of Russia, similarly wonderful, are no different. Only that, while in the Cold War the Russians were to our “east,” today, in the context of this century’s great Arctic game and Canada’s great northern interests, the Russians are due north of us.

				Troops under Russian command stand firmly after firing their weapons into the air and screaming orders to turn back at an approaching group of more than 100 unarmed Ukrainian troops at the Belbek airbase, which the Russian troops are occcupying in Crimea, Ukraine, on Tuesday.
			MOSCOW—Accusing the West of encouraging an “unconstitutional coup” in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that Moscow reserves the right to use its military to protect Russians there but hopes it won’t need to. The Russian leader’s first comments on Ukraine since its fugitive president fled came as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Kyiv to meet with Ukraine’s new government.Putin declared that Western actions were driving Ukraine into anarchy and warned that any sanctions the West places on Russia for its actions there will backfire.“We aren’t going to fight the Ukrainian people,” Putin said, adding that the massive military manoeuvres Russia had been doing involving 150,000 troops near Ukraine’s border had been previously planned and were unrelated to the current situation in Ukraine. He ordered the troops back to their bases.The U.S. announced a $1-billion aid package Tuesday in energy subsidies to Ukraine, which faces a looming financial disaster. NATO members met in Brussels and announced that the alliance would hold talks Wednesday with Russian officials about Ukraine, while world markets rose, buoyed by Putin’s apparent efforts to de-escalate tensions.“We are going to do our best (to help you). We are going to try very hard,” Kerry said upon arriving in Kyiv. “We hope Russia will respect the election that you are going to have.”Ukraine’s finance minister, who says the country needs $35 billion to get through this year and next, was meeting with International Monetary Fund officials.Tensions remained high in Crimea, with troops loyal to Moscow firing warning shots to ward off protesting Ukrainian soldiers. Heavily armed pro-Russian forces took over the strategic peninsula on Saturday, surrounding its ferry, military bases and border posts. Two Ukrainian warships remained anchored in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, blocked from leaving by Russian ships.Yet world markets seemed to recover from their fright over Ukraine, clawing back a large chunk of Monday’s stock losses, while oil, gold, wheat and the Japanese yen gave back some of their gains. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 200 points Tuesday on the news that Putin had pulled back troops from Ukraine’s border.“Confidence in equity markets has been restored as the standoff between Ukraine and Russia is no longer on red alert,” said David Madden, market analyst at IG.Putin also insisted that the Russian military deployment in Crimea has remained within the limits set by a bilateral agreement on a Russian military base there. He said Russia had no intention of annexing Crimea, but insisted its residents have the right to determine the region’s status in a referendum set for later this month.Putin accused the West of using Yanukovych’s decision in November to ditch a pact with the EU in favour of closer ties with Russia to encourage the months of protests that drove him from power and put Ukraine’s future in turmoil.“We have told them a thousand times ‘Why are you splitting the country?’ ” he said.Yet he acknowledged that Yanukovych has no political future and said Russia gave him shelter only to save his life. Ukraine’s new government wants to put the fugitive leader on trial for the deaths of more than 80 people during protests last month in Kyiv.At the House of Commons in London, British Foreign Minister William Hague rejected Putin’s arguments.“The suggestion that a president who has fled his country then has any authority whatsoever to invite the forces of a neighbouring country into that country is baseless,” he told U.K. lawmakers.Ukraine’s dire finances were a key issue in the protests that drove Yanukovych from power. On Tuesday, Russia’s state-controlled natural gas giant Gazprom said it will cancel a price discount on gas it sells to Ukraine. Russia had offered the discount in December as part of Russian help for Ukraine. Gazprom also said Ukraine owes it $1.5 billion.Crimea still remained a potential flashpoint. Pro-Russian troops who had taken control of the Belbek air base in Crimea fired warning shots into the air Tuesday as around 300 Ukrainian soldiers, who previously manned the airfield, demanded their jobs back.About a dozen soldiers at the base warned the Ukrainians, who were marching unarmed, not to approach. They fired several warning shots into the air and said they would shoot the Ukrainians if they continued to march toward them.Part of the same compound was still being held by Ukrainians.“We are worried. But we will not give up our base,” said Capt. Nikolai Syomko, an air force radio electrician holding an AK-47 and patrolling the back of the compound. He said the soldiers felt they were being held hostage, caught between Russia and Ukraine.Putin said the 22,000-strong Ukrainian force in Crimea has dissolved and its arsenals have fallen into the hands of the local government. Those officials claimed Tuesday that 5,500 Ukrainian soldiers had switched their allegiance from Kyiv to them and said they were seeking to move up a vote planned for March 30 on the region’s status.Russia is demanding the implementation of a Western-sponsored peace deal that Yanukovych signed with the opposition last month that set a new Ukrainian presidential election no later than December. Yanukovych fled the capital hours after the signing and ended up in Russia, and the Ukrainian parliament then set the vote for May 25.John Herbst, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who now is director of the Center for Complex Operations at the National Defence University, told the AP it was a critical time for Europe.“It’s a breach of international law, of national sovereignty, by a major power,” Herbst said about Russia’s actions in Crimea. “We haven’t seen such a breach in Europe since the Nazis.”Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…
				Russian armoured personnel carriers are parked on the side of the road near the town of Bakhchisarai, Ukraine, between the port city of Sevastopol and the regional capital, Sinferopol.
			SEVASTOPOL, UKRAINE—Ukraine’s acting president urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop “provocations” in Crimea and pull back military forces from the peninsula.Oleksandr Turchynov, who stepped in as president after Viktor Yanukovych fled Kyiv last weekend, said Friday that the Ukrainian military would fulfill its duty but would not be drawn into provocations.After heavily armed men in military uniform arrived at strategic facilities in Crimea, Ukraine accused Russia of “military invasion and occupation” — a claim that brought an alarming new dimension to the crisis.Any Russian military incursion in Crimea would dramatically raise the stakes in Ukraine’s conflict, which saw Yanukovych flee last weekend after three months of anti-government protests. Yanukovych vowed Friday at a news conference in Russia to “keep fighting for the future of Ukraine,” though he called any military action “unacceptable.”In Kyiv, Ukraine’s parliament adopted a resolution demanding that Russia halt steps it says are aimed against Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and it called for a UN Security Council meeting on the crisis.The chief of Ukraine’s security council, Andriy Parubiy, seemed to strike a less strident tone, saying gunmen had tried to “seize” the airports in the Crimean cities of Simferopol and Sevastopol. However, he insisted in comments to the Interfax news agency that “the airports are controlled by the law enforcement bodies of Ukraine.”Ukraine’s State Border Guard Service also said about 30 Russian marines from Russia’s Black Sea Fleet — which is based in Sevastopol — had taken up position outside the Ukrainian Coast Guard base in the area. It said the marines were there to prevent any weapons at the base from being seized by extremists.AP journalists in Crimea spotted a convoy of nine Russian armoured personnel carriers and a truck on a road between Sevastopol and Simferopol, the regional capital. The Russian tricolour flags were painted on the vehicles, which were parked on the side of the road near the town of Bakhchisarai, apparently because one of them had mechanical problems.Russia is supposed to notify Ukraine of any troop movements outside the naval base it maintains in Sevastopol under a lease agreement with Ukraine.The Russian Foreign Ministry said movements of armoured vehicles belonging to the Russian Black Sea Fleet were prompted by the need to ensure security of its base and didn’t contradict the lease terms.A duty officer at the Ukrainian Defence Ministry said it had no information about the vehicles’ movements.Yanukovych made his first public appearance since fleeing Ukraine in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, not far from the Ukrainian border. It was the first confirmation that he had left the country, and he said he was “forced” to do so only after his family received threats.“I intend to keep fighting for the future of Ukraine,” he said.Associated Press journalists approaching the Sevastopol airport found the road leading up to it blocked by two military trucks and a handful of gunmen wearing camouflage uniforms and carrying assault rifles.A car with Russian military plates was stopped at the roadblock. A man wearing a military uniform with a Russian flag on his sleeve got out of the car and was allowed to enter on foot after a brief discussion with the gunmen.At the airport serving Simferopol, commercial flights were landing and taking off despite dozens of armed men in military uniforms without markings patrolling with assault rifles. They didn’t stop or search people leaving or entering the airport, and refused to talk to journalists.One man who identified himself only as Vladimir said the men were part of the Crimean People’s Brigade, which he described as a self-defence unit ensuring that no “radicals and fascists” arrive from other parts of Ukraine. There was no way to verify his account.The airport deployments came a day after masked gunmen with rocket-propelled grenades and sniper rifles seized the parliament and government offices in Simferopol and raised the Russian flag. Ukrainian police cordoned off the area but didn’t confront the gunmen. They remained in control of the buildings Friday.The Russian foreign and defence ministries had no comment. Russia’s state RIA Novosti and Interfax cited an unidentified official from the Russian Black Sea Fleet denying involvement, saying Russian servicemen stationed in Crimea have not moved into the airports and denying that the Russian military was in control there.Tensions between the two countries were high, however. Russia continued with massive combat readiness exercises involving most of its troops in western and southern Russia that it said were unrelated to the Ukraine conflict. The moves were reminiscent of Cold War brinksmanship.The Kremlin, in a statement published late Thursday, said Putin had instructed the government to “maintain contacts with the counterparts in Kyiv in what concerns trade and economic ties between Russia and Ukraine.”Moscow has been sending mixed signals about Ukraine but pledged to respect its territorial integrity. Putin has long dreamed of pulling Ukraine, a country of 46 million people considered the cradle of Russian civilization, closer into Moscow’s orbit.Meanwhile, Swiss prosecutors announced they had launched a criminal investigation against Yanukovych and his son Aleksander over “aggravated money laundering.” They said police and Geneva’s chief prosecutor conducted a search and seized documents Thursday at the premises of a company owned by Aleksander Yanukovych.Ukraine’s population is divided in loyalties between Russia and the West, with much of western Ukraine advocating closer ties with the European Union while eastern and southern regions look to Russia for support.Crimea, a southeastern peninsula of Ukraine that has semi-autonomous status, was seized by Russian forces in the 18th century under Catherine the Great, and was once the crown jewel in Russian and then Soviet empires.It became part of Ukraine in 1954 when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred jurisdiction from Russia, a move that was a mere formality until the 1991 Soviet collapse meant Crimea landed in an independent Ukraine.In a bid to shore up Ukraine’s fledgling administration, the International Monetary Fund has said it is “ready to respond” to Ukraine’s bid for financial assistance; Ukraine’s finance ministry has said it needs $35 billion over the next two years to avoid default.The European Union is also considering emergency loans for a country that is the chief conduit of Russian natural gas to western Europe.And Putin, in his statement, asked his government to “hold consultations with foreign partners including the IMF and the G8 nations to provide financial aid to Ukraine.”We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				Ukraine is holding its presidential election on May 25. Prime Minister Stephen Harper says Canada will send up to 500 people to monitor the election next month.
			KYIV, UKRAINE—Ottawa is washing its hands of an “unfortunate” pay dispute that has sparked rebellion in the advance team for Canada’s ambitious mission to monitor the upcoming Ukrainian election.The first wave of 15 Canadian observers already on the ground is the pointy tip of a civilian deployment that will eventually number 500 Canadians for Ukraine’s crucial presidential vote on May 25.But on Monday, the advance team went public with a story of broken promises, accusing bureaucrats of tearing up their financial agreement after the fact and imposing a frugal new compensation package that some say will leave them subsidizing the mission out of their own pockets.“We have put ourselves in potential danger and the bureaucrats are reneging on signed contracts. Maybe they should come over here and discuss the situation with the ‘green men,’ ” team member Peter Chabursky told the Star, alluding to the mysterious masked gunmen who have seized control of a dozen cities and towns in east Ukraine.Ottawa doesn’t dispute that the observers feel deceived and that promises were broken — but federal bureaucrats say the source of their grievance is Canadem, a struggling Ottawa-based non-profit organization co-ordinating the civilian mission on their behalf.Halfway through the first-wave deployment, Canadian observers in Ukraine were shocked to learn that their compensation package would be slashed. Each observer would continue to receive an honorarium of $150 a day. But an additional per diem of €195 (nearly $300) a day to cover the cost of hotels, meals and incidentals — the norm for missions involving the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe — would fall by as much as two-thirds.Canadem executive director Paul LaRose-Edwards apologized to the group in an email obtained by the Star, saying, “We are as caught out as you.” Foreign Affairs took exception to LaRose-Edwards’ email in a statement to the Star, suggesting Canadem made promises it was never in a position to make, and then wrongly blamed the government.“Canadem’s email to stakeholders is misleading and unfortunate and the head of the organization acknowledged to DFATD officials last week that this payment error was their mistake,” the statement said.“The provisions for reimbursement were clearly stated in the contribution agreement with Canadem before observers were deployed, and this was further clarified with the organization two weeks ago.”Canada’s 15-member advance delegation, composed of veteran aid workers with past experience as election observers, is the largest team in the 100-member international Long Term Observer Mission already on the ground in Ukraine. The mission also includes a dozen Americans and observers from the U.K., Poland, Scandinavia and western Europe. They role is the make initial contact with Ukrainian electoral offices, courts and other officials to lay the groundwork for the arrival of short term observers in May.The Canadian delegation said the new rules, which adopt National Joint Council rates for meals and incidentals, now require them to somehow retroactively collect hotel receipts for the first half of their time in Ukraine. If they cannot obtain receipts after the fact, they will be compensated at a lower rate that may not cover their out-of-pocket expenses.But the prospects of Canadem making good on its original agreement with the observers appear slim. Larose-Edwards, in the email obtained by the Star, acknowledged, “Legally, Canadem does not have a leg to stand on.”Having already laid off half its staff this year and slashed the salaries of those who remain, he said, Canadem is not in a position to absorb the loss.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				After Sunday's attack at a checkpoint in eastern Ukraine, images quickly appeared on Russian TV, purporting to show evidence somehow retrieved intact from two smouldering attack vehicles — a bundle of U.S. dollars, Nazi-era weaponry, a satellite map of the region and a telltale business card bearing the name of the Right Sector, a Ukrainian ultranationalist group.
			BYLBASOVKA, UKRAINE—First came the bullets. Then, almost as quickly, the fog of war — dense, dubious, yet debatable — draped over the scene, adding truth to the list of Ukraine’s latest casualties.What we can say with a high degree of certainty is that here in the most volatile region of eastern Ukraine, a local population enraged over an Easter Sunday shootout that killed at least one of their own now feels even greater affinity with Russia — even if Moscow itself may have been behind the attack.Contradictions abound in the details of the early morning raid on a remote checkpoint 14 kilometres northwest of the separatist-occupied city of Slovyansk. The audacious attack shattered an Easter truce, killing, according to the earliest accounts, as many as five men. Images emerged quickly on Russian television, showing a trove of evidence that was somehow retrieved unblemished from two smouldering attack vehicles — a bundle of U.S. dollars, Nazi-era weaponry, a satellite map of the region and a telltale business card bearing the name of the Right Sector, the Ukrainian ultranationalist group that swiftly bore the brunt of Moscow’s blame.Ukraine has failed to disarm “separatists and terrorists,” enabling the Right Sector to unleash chaos in the east, Russia’s Foreign Ministry charged.Kyiv countered quickly, accusing Moscow of staging a crude, made-for-TV provocation. The Right Sector’s spokesman, Artem Skoropadsky, said the attack was “clearly carried out by Russian special forces.Here at the scene near the hamlet of Bylbasovka, TV crews arrived, gobbled up the contradictions and left. But the Toronto Star lingered. And with the afternoon sun there came a gradual parade of villagers bearing bundles of carnations and tulips. Not a show for the cameras — ours was the only one left — but an actual outpouring of grief and respect for a much-loved local man, Sergei Rodenko, 53, who was killed at the checkpoint.“Sergei was our very good friend — he drove the school bus,” said Olga Lugavienka, whose three children all rode Rodenko’s bus. Her eldest son, now 21, had routinely been at Rodenko’s side working overnight shifts at the checkpoint, which sprang up two weeks ago to protect the village when the anti-Kyiv unrest erupted. But on this fateful night, he took a break, attending the midnight Easter church service instead.Others from the village spoke of the vulnerability of the local roadblock, insisting that those manning it were virtually unarmed.“They had no guns, just sticks. Why shoot a man who only holds a stick?” he said, reaching down to pick up one of the weapons in question — a chunk of tree branch wrapped in duct tape.Rednytsky said he arrived on the scene immediately following Sunday’s 2 a.m. attack and found two bodies. He recognized only Rodenko’s, which lay lifeless with a bullet hole between the eyes. “Like a sniper shot,” said Rednytsky. A third victim, he said, died en route to hospital.Rednytsky was unable to explain other inconsistencies. How did two of the attacking vehicles — two others were said to have escaped — come to be engulfed in fire? Another villager suggested the checkpoint crew had not just sticks but Molotov cocktails at their disposal.Nor can they explain who the other victims were. But the loss of bus driver Rodenko — and the anger it engendered — was all they needed to trump all doubt. Everyone here agreed this was doubtless the work of the Right Sector. And the final straw, said Rednytsky, for peace with Kyiv.The checkpoint was the outermost of a cluster of barriers created by pro-Russia activists now in control of Slovyansk, a once-thriving industrial city of 150,000 that today suffers high unemployment amid shuttered factories.The town was edgy before Sunday’s attack, beset by what Ukraine’s Interior Ministry calls an increasing influx of armed gangsters. Before declaring a nighttime curfew Sunday, self-styled “people’s mayor” Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, who leads the local insurgency, issued a call for help from Moscow, once again tweaking Ukrainian fears that Russian soldiers will soon be marching this way.“I want to ask the Russian government and Vladimir Putin to send us help,” said Ponomaryov.“If you can’t send peacekeepers, help us by sending food, weapons, everything you can. Our people are ready to stand until the end to protect our land from the fascist invasion.”Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…

			KYIV—Warning that it is “on the brink of disaster,” Ukraine’s interim government put its military on high alert Sunday and appealed for international help to avoid what it feared was a possible Russian invasion of its eastern provinces.Elsewhere, international leaders, worried that Europe’s borders were suddenly being rewritten by force, rushed to find a diplomatic solution to the dispute.But there was no denying what had already happened on the ground: Moscow had overrun the Black Sea peninsula without firing a shot — and the mostly ethnic-Russian eastern regions could be next to fall.In Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city, only 30 kilometres from the eastern border, a sprawling pro-Russian protest camp occupied the central square, and Russian flags were on display. Many in the city said they would prefer that Russian troops invade rather than submit to Kyiv’s rule.“I would welcome them with flowers,” said Alexander Sorokin, 55, a pensioner walking by riot police guarding the administration building. “We do not want to spill blood, but we are willing to do so.”Russia’s gloves come off as the insignia go onFaced with this cascade of threats, Ukraine’s new government moved to consolidate its authority. It named new regional governors in the pro-Russia east, enlisted the support of the country’s wealthy businessmen and dismissed the country’s naval chief after he declared allegiance to the pro-Russian regional government in Crimea.Officials said they were hoping these moves would dampen secessionist hopes in the east and keep violent outbreaks — like clashes between pro-Western and pro-Russian protesters in Kharkiv on Saturday that put at least 100 people in the hospital — from providing a rationale for an invasion by Moscow in the name of protecting ethnic Russians.At the same time, they sought international help.“We believe that our western partners and the entire global community will support the territorial integrity and unity of Ukraine,” Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Sunday in KyivSaying Russia had no good reason to invade Ukraine, he warned that “we are on the brink of disaster.”“This is the red alert. This is not a threat, this is actually a declaration of war to my country.”What began three months ago as a protest against the government of pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych has unexpectedly turned into a big-power confrontation reminiscent of the Cold War and a significant challenge to international agreements on the sanctity of the borders of post-Soviet nations.NATO held an emergency meeting Sunday in Brussels, Britain’s foreign minister flew to Kyiv to support its new government, and the Group of Seven nations said they were suspending plans for the next G8 economic summit, scheduled for Sochi in June.In Kyiv, Moscow and other cities, thousands of protesters took to the streets to either decry the Russian occupation or celebrate Crimea’s return to its former ruler.“Support us, America!” a handful of protesters chanted outside the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. One young girl held a placard reading: “No Russian aggression!”In Moscow, at least 10,000 people bearing Russian flags and chanting “Russia! Russia!” marched freely through the city Sunday in support of the Crimea takeover. “We understand that the West wants to attack us and seize this territory. (The West) is dangerous to us,” said Victor Sidelin, one of those marching.About 260 people demonstrating in Red Square against the invasion were quickly detained by riot police.NATO issued a statement saying it “condemns Russia’s military escalation in Crimea” and demanding that Russia respect its obligations under the UN charter. Ukraine is not a NATO member, meaning the U.S. and Europe are not obligated to come to its defence, but the country has taken part in some alliance exercises.Putin has defied calls from the West to pull back his troops, insisting Russia has a right to protect its interests and those of Russian-speakers in Crimea and elsewhere in Ukraine.His confidence is matched by the knowledge that Ukraine’s 46 million people have divided loyalties. While much of western Ukraine wants closer ties with the 28-nation European Union, its eastern and southern regions like Crimea look to Russia for support.Russia has long wanted to reclaim the lush Crimean Peninsula, part of its territory until 1954. Russia’s Black Sea Fleet pays Ukraine millions every year to be stationed at the Crimean port of Sevastopol and nearly 60 per cent of Crimea’s residents identify themselves as Russian.On Sunday Moscow kept up its propaganda campaign in defence of the Crimean takeover, citing undefined threats to Russian citizens and proclaiming large defections of Ukrainian forces in Crimea, which Western reporters said appeared to be unfounded.During a phone conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Putin “directed her attention to the unrelenting threat of violence from ultranationalist forces (in Ukraine) that endangered the life and legal interests of Russian citizens,” according to a Kremlin statement.Ukraine’s new government came to power last week following months of pro-democracy protests against Yanukovych and his decision to turn Ukraine toward Russia instead of the EU. Yanukovych fled to Russia after over 80 people were killed in the protests. He insists he’s still president.The acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, put the country’s armed forces on alert and stepped up security at nuclear plants, airports and other strategic locations. The government also issued a decree to begin calling up reservists for training but no overt military actions by Ukraine have been seen.Turchynov also appointed 18 new regional governors, including two oligarchs in the eastern cities of Dneprotrovsk and Donetsk, as big business and the new government united against Moscow. Ukraine’s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov, called Russia’s use of force “impermissible.”Russian troops, meanwhile, pulled up to the Ukrainian military base at Perevalne on the Crimean Peninsula in a convoy Sunday that included at least 13 trucks and four armoured vehicles with mounted machine-guns. The trucks carried 30 soldiers each and had Russian licence plates.In response, a dozen Ukrainian soldiers, some with clips in their rifles, placed a tank at the base’s gate, leaving the two sides in a tense standoff. It appeared to be the first known case of outmatched Ukrainians standing up to Russian military might.Unidentified soldiers were also seen cutting power to the headquarters of Ukrainian Naval forces in Crimea — whose own commander defected later Sunday.In Kyiv, a Ukrainian security official said Adm. Denis Berezovsky had been dismissed and faces a treason investigation after declaring his allegiance to the pro-Russian government of the Crimea region.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…The president has reportedly left his palace in Kiev a day after he reached a deal with opposition leaders aimed at ending the long-running crisis.The political landscape in Ukraine has flipped again, less than one day after a compromise was signed to end a week of bloody violence in the capital of Kyiv.New elections were announced for May 25. The president’s chief political rival was freed from prison, and the head of the Ukrainian army has vowed not to get involved.However, the future remains uncertain. Yanukovych is crying foul about what he termed a coup d’etat, saying he would not recognize any of the lawmakers’ decisions, even though the parliamentary vote to impeach him was overwhelming. An emotional Yulia Tymoshenko made her way from prison in eastern Ukraine to Independence Square to address the pro-democracy movement that secured her freedom after more than two years behind bars.“The people who died here are the heroes,” Tymoshenko told protesters from a wheelchair. She developed severe back problems when she was in prison, some of that time served in solitary confinement.Yanukovych has fled to Kharkiv in the country’s Russian-speaking east and the base of his political power.“They are trying to scare me. I have no intention to leave the country. I am not going to resign; I’m the legitimately elected president,” a shaken Yanukovych said in a televised statement.Nearly 100 people died and hundreds more were injured after pro-European demonstrators, known as the Euromaidan, named after central Kyiv’s Independence Square, stood up to Yanukovych’s political regime, demanding he resign for failing to uphold the people’s wishes and form closer ties to Europe. But the demonstrations turned horrific this past week as government forces fired live ammunition against the demonstrators and gangs of roving government-backed thugs marched through the streets of Kyiv.The crisis now shifts away from the capital to the east and Crimea in the south — both Russian speaking areas — where there are rumblings that some regions may ask Russia for assistance.The quickly shifting political landscape in Ukraine now threatens the security of all Eastern and Central Europe, and some fear the country could divide between those loyal to Moscow and those leaning towards Europe.All of the upheaval in Ukraine comes not even a day after a compromise was brokered by Germany, Poland and France and signed by Yanukovych and the opposition. The pact saw Yanukovych’s power reduced to 2004 levels, led to a coalition government and paved the way to ending the violence that has shook Kyiv for the past week.That agreement, which was not welcomed by many demonstrators in Independence Square, is now effectively void. The Russian witness to the deal also refused to sign it.Russia had offered to financially rescue the cash-strapped nation of 46 million, but only if the former Soviet bloc country turned away from greater economic ties with the EU.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

Ottawa has provided $220 million in aid to the interim Ukrainian government and has slapped travel bans and economic sanctions on dozens of officials and oligarchs aligned with Putin and the former Viktor Yanukovych government.Later in the day, Harper, along with Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird, Justice Minister Peter MacKay and members of the Ukranian Canadian diaspora travelling with him, placed carnations at a shrine in memory of the martyrs of the Maidan, just off Independence Square.PHOTOS:Protesters at the squareThe protests began in late November when Yanukovych accepted $15 billion in aid from Russia and turned Ukraine’s back on talks with the European Union.

				A masked pro-Russian activist guards a barricade at the regional administration building in Donetsk, Ukraine on Tuesday.
			IZYUM, UKRAINE—Busloads of Ukrainian troops and a handful of tanks set up Tuesday outside an eastern city controlled by armed pro-Russian militiamen as the country's acting president announced an “anti-terrorist operation” to root out the separatists.Much of the focus Tuesday was around the eastern city of Slovyansk, 160 kilometres from the Russian border, which has come under the increasing control of the gunmen who seized it last weekend.An Associated Press reporter saw at least 14 armoured personnel carriers with Ukrainian flags, one helicopter and military trucks parked 40 kilometres north of the city. Other heavy military equipment appeared nearby, along with at least seven busloads of government troops in black military fatigues.“We are awaiting the order to move on Sloyvansk,” said one soldier, who gave only his first name, Taras.Two of the helicopters loaded with troops later took off and headed toward Slovyansk.RIA Novosti said the troops drove to the airport in an armoured personnel carrier, started talking to the gunmen who control the site and a skirmish broke out. It did not elaborate.The armed pro-Russian militias are occupying government, police and other administrative buildings in at least nine cities in Ukraine's Russian-speaking east of the country, demanding broader autonomy and closer ties with Russia. The central government has so far been unable to rein in the insurgents, and many local security forces have switched to their side.Prior to the reported government offensive, roads into Slovyansk were dotted Tuesday with militia checkpoints, at least one with a Russian flag. Another bore a sign “If we don't do it, nobody will.”The threat the Ukrainian military posed to the highly organized, pro-Russian insurgents was unclear. One video posted online late Monday showed a hapless Ukrainian tank stuck in the mud in a field reportedly outside Slovyansk. Residents chased it on foot, shouting “Who are you going to fire at?”The government in Kyiv, the capital, for days has been promising to deploy troops to root out the armed separatists, but until Tuesday there was little visible action.Russia itself still has tens of thousands of troops massed along Ukraine's eastern border. Western governments accuse Moscow of fueling the unrest in eastern Ukraine and worry that any bloodshed could be used as a pretext for a Russian invasion, in a repeat of events in Crimea a few weeks ago.Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula after seizing it last month following the ouster of Ukraine's pro-Russian president in February.Backing up its claims that Russia was behind the unrest, Ukraine's security services on Tuesday identified one of the leaders of the pro-Russian operation in Slovyansk as a Russian foreign intelligence agent named Igor Strelkov. It said Strelkov also co-ordinated Russian troops in Crimea during the seizure of military facilities there.In a phone call Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin urged President Barack Obama to discourage the Ukrainian government from using force against protesters in the country's east.A wave of sit-ins, meanwhile, has hit the eastern city of Horlivka, where a police station was seized Monday by unidentified gunmen. Outside the station, a sign pinned to a barricade of tires listed items required by protesters, including blankets, drinking water and tape to cover up windows smashed during the storming.Anatoly Zhurov, a 53-year-old Horlivka resident, said the insurgents' goal was to resist the government in Kyiv.Elsewhere, the Interior Ministry said a police station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk that had been seized by pro-Russian gunmen was “liberated” Tuesday.Ukraine's acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, gave few details of the “anti-terrorist operation” to the parliament in Kyiv, saying only that it would be conducted in a “responsible and balanced” manner. He blamed Russia for sponsoring the camouflage-wearing insurgents, who are often armed and move with a precision unlikely for local militia.“(Russia wants) the whole south and east of Ukraine to be engulfed by fire,” Turchynov said, adding the government operation aimed to “defend the citizens of Ukraine, to stop terror, stop crime and stop attempts to tear our country into pieces.”Russia strongly warned Kyiv against using force against the pro-Russian protesters, saying that could prompt Moscow to walk out of Thursday's international conference on Ukraine in Geneva.“You can't send in tanks and at the same time hold talks. The use of force would sabotage the opportunity offered by the four-party negotiations in Geneva,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday.“Ukraine is on the verge of a civil war, it's horrible,” Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said in Moscow, adding that Ukraine's government must talks with all segments of its populationUkraine has relied on cheap gas supplies from Russia for years. Moscow raised the gas prices for Kyiv in the past weeks, leaving Ukraine scrambling to pay the mounting gas bills as well as past bills that Putin now says adds up to over $35 billion.In the wake of Moscow's threats to cut off energy supplies to Ukraine, the German utility company RWE AG said Tuesday it has started supplying gas to Ukraine via Poland and could sell it up to 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year. Ukraine consumes between 52 and 55 billion cubic meters of gas a year.In Kyiv, two pro-Russian politicians were attacked by pro-Western activists as tensions mounted over unrest in the east.Oleh Tsaryov, a pro-Russian lawmaker and a candidate in the May 25 presidential elections, was beaten by dozens of enraged activists early Tuesday as he was leaving a television studio. The activists pelted him with eggs, shouted insults and then assaulted him.The Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office said it has opened a probe into the attack — as well as a criminal case against Tsaryov's calls to “encroach on Ukraine's territorial integrity.” The lawmaker has met with pro-Russian protesters in Donetsk.Moscow has accused the Kyiv authorities of condoning such radicalism and says attacks against pro-Russian candidates show that the presidential election will not be fair or democratic.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				A man with a Russian flag greets armed men in military fatigues blocking access to a Ukrainian border guards base not far from the village of Perevalne near Simferopol in Crimea on Monday.
			In an urgently worded letter to the UN Security Council Monday, Ukraine detailed Russia’s steady advances in Crimea, including a naval blockade of Ukrainian navy ships, the capture of military and border facilities, and delivery of a supposed ultimatum for the surrender of Ukraine’s forces on the peninsula.Meanwhile, threats and condemnations from the U.S. and European capitals have had little effect. And Moscow’s relentless takeover of its onetime territory underscored the extent to which the levers of power over Russia have slipped out of Western hands.In the U.S., calls for strong action were loudest. James Stavridis, NATO’s former Supreme Allied Commander, wrote in Foreign Policy that “hope is not a strategy and further action should be considered.”He urged an emergency session of the 28-member alliance to consider options such as sending up spy drones and sharing information with Ukraine; gearing up NATO operations for a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, raising the NATO Response Force to higher alert and sailing its maritime forces into the Black Sea.Russia is gambling that the West’s response will be far lower-key — and with good reason.“The credibility of Western leaders was taken back because of the ‘red line’ that was crossed in Syria, (with chemical weapons)” says Thomas Scotto of University of Essex, who has conducted research in the U.S. and Britain on public attitudes to military involvement overseas.There was little public outcry when American and other leaders backed down, says Scotto. “I don’t see that there is any move among the public for open conflict. A lot of what has happened in the Middle East made people in the U.S. and Britain fatigued with wars.”European countries are also divided on the stiffness of sanctions against Russia, which has multi-billion-dollar energy contracts with Europe, as well as murky financial dealings.President Vladimir Putin “knows that European bureaucrats will issue shrill statements and then get back to business helping Russian elites buy London town houses and French chateaux,” says Ben Judah, author of Fragile Empire, in Politico Magazine. “He knows full well that the United States can no longer force Europe to trade in a different way . . . he thinks he has nothing to lose.”Gordon Smith, a distinguished fellow of the Centre for International Governance Innovation, agrees that threats to expel Russia from the elite financial club “won’t cause Putin to lose one minute’s sleep.”Smith, a G-7/G-8 “Sherpa” under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien in the 1990s, recalled the debate over allowing Russia to join the group of wealthy nations. “There was controversy about whether it was premature, and doubts that Russia could participate as a fully fledged democracy. Now we’ve come full circle.”“Three things about Putin are very clear,” says Russia expert Piotr Dutkiewicz, of Carleton University, who has met the Russian leader 10 times.“First, if he makes a decision he sticks to it. Second, he’s very pragmatic, and not driven by emotion or ideology. Third, he can be persuaded to adjust if the arguments on the table coincide with his sense of Russia’s national interest.”That is the opening for negotiation, Dutkiewicz says — and possibly the only way of ending the standoff. But the terms may be hard for both Ukraine and the West to swallow.They could include accepting more autonomy for Crimea and Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, giving the Russian Black Sea fleet a permanent base in Crimea, allowing Ukraine’s government to sign Putin’s coveted customs agreement with Russia in addition to an EU pact, and earmarking cabinet positions for Russian-speakers in Kyiv, he said.But he admits, “nobody really knows what Putin thinks.

				A pro-Russian militant holding a bat guards a barricade in front of the Donetsk regional administration building on Tuesday.
			DONETSK, UKRAINE—Ukraine’s government struggled to stay in control of the country’s eastern regions as tensions flared Tuesday in three cities. While the government managed to recapture its regional headquarters and detain dozens of pro-Russian protesters in one city, it said “radicals” were keeping 60 people hostage in another city.Unknown “separatists” with weapons and explosives were threatening the hostages inside a security service branch in the city of Luhansk, the Ukrainian Security Service said in a statement Tuesday.It was not clear who the hostages were or if they were security service employees. The building was seized Sunday by armed pro-Russian protesters.Earlier Tuesday, Ukrainian authorities battled with pro-Russian protesters but regained control over a government building in Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, evicting the protesters and detaining dozens.In Donetsk, a city 250 kilometres further south, protesters dug in for their third day at the 11-storey regional administration headquarters they captured on Sunday and began to declare their own parallel government.Serhiy Taruta, the governor of Donetsk, scoffed at the shifting events in his city.“I call this a theatre of the absurd,” he said. “It is just artists performing, but the main thing is that there is an ever-dwindling audience.”All three cities are in Ukraine’s east, where hostility is strong toward the government that took power in February after the ouster of Kremlin-friendly President Viktor Yanukovych. Even though Ukraine’s interim authorities have achieved some success in quelling the unrest that swept across eastern provinces Sunday, festering discontent threatens to undermine plans to hold a presidential election on May 25.“What we see from Russia is an illegal and illegitimate effort to destabilize a sovereign state and create a contrived crisis with paid operatives across an international boundary,” Kerry told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Kerry called the demonstrations in eastern Ukraine a “contrived pretext for military intervention just as we saw in Crimea.”Addressing parliament in Kyiv, acting President Oleksandr Turchynov said security forces retook control of the Kharkiv administration building early Tuesday but several police were injured in the clashes with separatists.Interior Minister Arsen Avakov described the measure on his Facebook page as an “anti-terrorist operation.”
      'AN ANTI-TERRORIST OPERATION': Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, left, praised security forces Tuesday for retaking control of the Kharkiv administration building on his Facebook page.
    In a session briefly interrupted by a brawl, parliament also voted to toughen the punishment for undermining Ukraine’s national security, imposing jail terms of up to five years for separatism.In Donetsk, there was little sign Tuesday evening that government forces had any immediate plan to retake the regional administration building. No clear leader or agenda has emerged from the obscure group of pro-Russian Donetsk activists behind the standoff.A declaration adopted Monday claimed sovereignty for what they called the “Donetsk Republic” and demanded a referendum to be held no later than May 11. While none of them have said they necessarily want the region to join Russia, they have also declined to rule out the option.Even as the United States warned Russia of more sanctions, the White House announced a high-level meeting among U.S., EU, Ukrainian and Russian diplomats in the coming days to try to solve the crisis.In Moscow, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday that the date and format of the four-way talks hadn’t yet been agreed. He suggested that Ukraine’s presidential candidates could be invited to join the negotiations.The Kremlin has pushed for a constitutional reform in Ukraine that would turn the country into a federation with broad powers for its regions and ensure its neutrality. The demands reflected Russia’s desire to maintain influence over its neighbour and prevent Ukraine from joining NATO.

				Ukrainians hold a mass prayer service in the northeastern city of Kharkiv on Wednesday. Russia's foreign minister has warned that Moscow would mount a firm response if its citizens or interests come under attack in Ukraine.
			
  DONETSK, UKRAINE—
  
    Ukraine
  
  ’s highly publicized goal to recapture police stations and government buildings seized by pro-Russia forces in the east produced little action on the ground Wednesday but ignited foreboding words from Moscow.

  Separately, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement demanding that Ukraine pull its armed forces out of the crisis-ridden region. Russia, meanwhile, has tens of thousands of troops stationed in areas near the Ukrainian border.

  Ukraine’s interim government has accused Russia of
  
    orchestrating the unrest
  
  in eastern Ukraine.

  The Interior Ministry said police forced a group of armed insurgents out of the eastern village of Svyatogorsk on Wednesday, but did not give details of the action other than to say there were no injuries.

  Still, it’s unclear how much capacity Ukraine’s interim government in Kyiv has against the insurgents.

  A previous operation to reclaim seized buildings showed few results before it was suspended last week following international talks in Geneva that produced an agreement to
  
    de-escalate the crisis
  
  . Ukrainian forces claimed to have regained control of one small airport, but insurgents also seized armoured vehicles and reports said some Ukrainian soldiers had switched sides.

  The army is underfunded and poorly equipped after years of corruption and mismanagement under Viktor Yanukovych, the Russia-friendly president who fled the country in February after months of protests.

  Yanukovych’s ouster sparked wide anger in his support base in Ukraine’s east. The insurgents, who claim Ukraine’s post-Yanukovych government consists of nationalists who will suppress the east’s large Russian-speaking population, are demanding regional autonomy or even annexation by Russia, like the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea last month.

  The insurgents, whom Kyiv and the West claim have Russian backing and direction, have occupied buildings in at least 10 eastern cities.

  Eugene Rumer, director of the Russia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, says the strategy appears to be “spreading across the map like ink blots.”

  “They are a long ways away from merging into a large area, but this strategy is proving quite effective at challenging the power and authority of the Kyiv government, undermining Ukraine’s territorial integrity and spreading the insurgency over a vast region that otherwise the Russian military would struggle to occupy and control,” he wrote in an analysis.

  In Fesenko’s view, it’s impossible for Ukraine to restore control over the insurgent region by force.

  “Now the task is to block the spread of the separatist virus,” he said.

  The heart of the insurgent region — centred on the eastern city of Slovyansk, 160 kilometres west of the Russian border — has fallen into lawlessness. The order to resume the government operation came Tuesday after the
  
    bodies of two people
  
  allegedly abducted by pro-Russia insurgents were found in the area.

  The insurgents in the east are defying last week’s agreement in Geneva between Russia, Ukraine, the European Union and the United States that called for all sides to disarm militant groups in Ukraine and to vacate public buildings they are occupying.

  Right Sector members have occupied two buildings in the capital, Kyiv, for months, but Ukraine authorities say their priority is to get the gunmen in eastern Ukraine to vacate those buildings.

  In addition, Dutch, British and Danish fighter jets scrambled Wednesday afternoon after a pair of Russian bombers approached their airspace over the North Sea. The Russian TU-95 Bear jets were escorted by the
  
    NATO
  
  members’ aircraft until they departed.

  And the presidents of four post-Soviet republics and Ukraine’s foreign minister were meeting in Prague with EU nations Thursday to figure out how to stop Russia from blocking their increased ties.

				Anti-government protesters take cover as they are under fire reportedly from a police sniper during clashes police in the centre of Kyiv on Thursday.
			Video published by Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty show riot police and a sniper firing from fortified positions in the direction of protesters in Kiev. Rough Cut (no reporter narration).Canada has moved ahead of Washington by joining the European Union and slapping sanctions against Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his supporters as the world reeled from scenes of bloody carnage in Kyiv.While U.S. President Barack Obama has strongly condemned the bloodshed in Ukraine his government has not backed that up with sanctions.A fragile peace in Kyiv ended abruptly Thursday as renewed violence left dozens dead and hundreds wounded. Demonstrators vowed not to leave the capital’s Independence Square unless Yanukovych stepped down.The crisis in Kyiv is now teetering on the edge of a coup d’etat, with both sides reporting the use of real bullets, protesters being cut down by gunfire and the streets running red with blood. There are reports that more than 70 have died since Wednesday’s truce was called off. Many of the fallen were young. Demonstrators draped their bodies in the Ukrainian flag. Religious leaders said prayers and blessed the dead.As Kyiv burned and police snipers took aim from rooftops, fear fell on the city. The Ukraine parliament was evacuated and streets were empty. Cash machines were running low. Lines for fuel were extremely long, said Canadian citizen Mychailo Wynnyckyj, a 43-year-old professor living in Kyiv.“There is a panic in the city. Most gas stations have a two- to three-hour line, people trying to fill up because the rumour is they will run out of gas,” Wynnyckyj told the Star. “People are staying indoors glued to the Internet and TV sets, talking to relatives on the phone,” he said.Diplomatic efforts to stop the bloodshed reached a tipping point on Thursday. The foreign ministers from Germany, Poland and France flew to Kyiv to hold emergency talks with Yanukovych’s government. After those talks ended, the three emerged silently and then flew to Brussels, where the 28-nation European Union decided to impose sanctions against those behind the violence in Ukraine, including a travel ban and an asset freeze against some officials.British Prime Minister David Cameron also called Russian President Vladimir Putin and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. All three agreed that Ukraine should get behind the “idea of a road map put forward by European foreign ministers” to stop the violence, a statement from Downing Street said.Meanwhile what was happening on the streets of Kyiv exploded on social media with images of violence, the dead covered in white sheets and lying in hotel lobbies, videos of police shooting down protesters and first-hand accounts of the bloody riots. As Ukrainian-Canadians watched the horrific images coming out of Kyiv, a city of 3 million, many made travel arrangements to fly back to Ukraine and support the Euromaidan demonstrators. Euromaidan is the name used by the pro-democracy protesters after initial rallies in Independence Square.Toronto dentist Dr. Leonid Kovbel left for Kyiv on Thursday night to join the front lines of those fighting. This is the 33-year-old’s fourth trip since the crisis began in late November.The recent images out of Kyiv have shaken him and strengthened his resolve to make sure Ukraine remains committed toward greater ties with the EU and away from the grip of Russia.“You don’t expect something like this to happen with your own government in the 21st century. The people are so determined. They are not going anywhere. They are committed to staying,” Kovbel said. Ukraine, a former Soviet bloc nation, is split along two lines. The central-west part of the country, including Kyiv, favours strong ties with Europe, while the Russian-speaking east has more of a pull to Moscow.Wynnyckyj, a father or four small children, has frequently joined demonstrators but he chose to stay indoors Thursday. He said the streets outside his window, two subway stops from Independence Square, were eerily quiet, missing the rush-hour traffic. He could smell the burning tires used by protesters as a protective wall from police.“We’ve had young thugs walking around with baseball bats and masks and looking for cars that may be identified (as belonging to) the protesters. Last night, in one neighbourhood of Kyiv, 28 cars were burned. The neighbourhood is the equivalent of Etobicoke.”The acting interior minister was on television Thursday informing people that the police have been armed and will use force.“Live ammunition and weapons have been given to police, according to the interior minister. He has officially said lethal weapons and live rounds have been issued to police officers and they will be used and they have been used,” Wynnyckyj told the Star.“Nothing else will be accepted. There is only one person responsible for those deaths and he is not willing to go,” he said. “It is futile to negotiate. The only thing to negotiate now is his exit from the country.”“This is where we live. This is something we have to live through. It will end, sooner rather than later, but it is something the country must go through.” Many are now too young to remember what took place in the Second World War but everyone knows the history and stories of how Ukraine suffered then fell under Soviet control. Euromaidan supporters won’t let that happen again, he said.The current crisis began after Yanukovych refused to sign a deal of closer integration and trade with the EU on Nov. 21. Instead, he suddenly pivoted toward Moscow and a $15-billion loan promise from Putin, along with promises of cheaper fuel. The move frightened pro-EU Ukrainians, who felt Yanukovych was stepping back in time.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				  Terms and Conditions.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…WASHINGTON—There is “overwhelming evidence” that Russia is fomenting unrest in eastern Ukraine, the White House said Monday.However, it suggested that President Barack Obama had not yet concluded that the actions warrant broader sanctions on key Russian economic sectors.Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke Monday for the first time in more than two weeks. The Kremlin said Putin urged Obama to discourage the Ukrainian government from using force against protesters in the country’s east, while also rejecting western claims that Russian agents were involved in the protests.The White House confirmed that the two leaders spoke, but did not immediately provide details of the conversation.Administration officials did confirm that CIA chief John Brennan visited the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv over the weekend. Ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych accused Brennan of being behind Ukraine’s decision to send troops into the east to try to quash an increasingly brazen pro-Russian insurgency.Since Obama and Putin last spoke, pro-Russian forces have undertaken a rampage of storming and occupying local government offices, police stations and a small airport in eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian government has proved powerless to rein in the separatists, who are demanding more autonomy from the central government in Kyiv and closer ties to Russia.The White House has blamed the unrest on Russia, saying there are undeniable similarities between the situation in eastern Ukraine and the Kremlin’s manoeuvres in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine last month.Despite those assertions, it was unclear whether the U.S. planned to respond with deeper economic penalties. Obama has repeatedly warned that Russian advances into eastern Ukraine would mark a serious escalation of the crisis that would warrant a stronger international response, including the prospect of sanctions on Russia’s energy sector and other key industries.But the administration has avoided saying whether Russia’s actions in the east thus far have crossed that line. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s acting president urged the United Nations on Monday to send peacekeeping troops to eastern Ukraine.In a telephone call with Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, acting President Oleksandr Turchynov suggested that an “anti-terrorist operation” be conducted jointly by Ukrainian security forces and UN peacekeepers, according to the presidential website.Peacekeepers, however, would have to be authorized by the UN Security Council, where Russia holds a veto.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				  Terms and Conditions.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…Prime Minister Stephen Harper says Canada is sending six fighter jets to eastern Europe at the request of NATO.
				Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper — at right, with Chief of Defence Staff General Thomas Lawson — says a decision to send fighter jets to Eastern Europe is a reponse "to the concern that we have on what really is expansionism and militarism on the part of Russia under the presidency of Mr. (Vladimir) Putin."
			OTTAWA—An agreement to ease tensions along Ukraine’s eastern border is raising hopes that a diplomatic solution to the ongoing crisis can be found, even as clashes in the country’s eastern regions claimed lives.But even as diplomats worked to avoid further violence in the country, Canada and NATO allies continued to prepare for the possibility of a deepening crisis in the region. Harper said the move was a direct response to Russian expansionism in Ukraine.“This is in response to the situation that is developing there and, frankly, more generally to the concern that we have on what really is expansionism and militarism on the part of Russia,” Harper said Thursday.Harper said in a statement that Canada remains steadfastly behind Ukraine and will not “stand idly by” while the country’s sovereignty is challenged.Canada’s commitment — which was requested by NATO — came as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced that four-way talks between the U.S., the European Union, Russia and the Ukraine had resulted in a tentative agreement on initial steps to de-escalate tensions. The agreement calls on the two sides to halt violence, intimidation and provocative actions, according to reports. It also puts further Western economic sanctions against Russia on pause for the time being. Under the Geneva statement, protesters would be given amnesty if they comply with the demands, including the immediate disarmament of all illegally armed groups, and the return of all seized buildings to their rightful owners. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will oversee the process. Kerry called the deal “a good day’s work,” but said both sides need to translate the words into immediate action. “None of us leaves here with a sense that the job is done because of words on a paper,” Kerry told reporters in Geneva. Kerry added that if Moscow does not respect the commitment to de-escalate tensions, “we will have no choice but to impose further costs on Russia.” The agreement comes after a night of bloodshed in the southeastern city of Mariupol, just 60 km from the Russian border, according to Ukrainian authorities. Ukrainian police killed three pro-Russian fighters and wounded 13 others Thursday in an overnight attack on a national guard base. Special forces were deployed, according to Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, and 63 people were detained and weapons seized. Earlier this week, Ukraine sent troops into its eastern Donetsk region, where Kyiv said “armed extremists” operating under Russian direction had occupied government buildings. The masked militias operating in the region are reported to have sophisticated weaponry, stoking fears they’re backed by Moscow.Russian President Vladimir Putin called those fears “nonsense” on Thursday, but acknowledged for the first time that the masked troops involved in the annexation of Crimea were Russian soldiers. In Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama told reporters that it will take “several days” to know whether Russia and Ukraine will follow through on the Geneva agreement. “The question now becomes will . . . (Russia) use the influence that they’ve exerted in a disrupted way to restore some order so that Ukrainians can carry out an election, move forward with the decentralization reforms that they’ve proposed, stabilize their economy, and start getting back on the path of growth and democracy,” Obama said. Earlier Thursday, Obama spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and planned to speak with British Prime Minister David Cameron. The West will follow through with more economic sanctions, Obama said, unless they see progress on the ground in Ukraine.“My hope is that we actually do see follow through over the next several days. But I don’t think, given past performance, that we can count on that,” Obama said. “And we have to be prepared to potentially respond to what would continue to be efforts of interference by the Russians in eastern and southern Ukraine.”We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				Ukrainians stand at the funeral of Volodymyr Topiy on Tuesday. Topiy was found burned in the house of trade unions in Kyiv's Independence Square during recent clashes with police.
			KYIV, UKRAINE—In a sombre show of U.S. support for Ukraine's new leadership, Secretary of State John Kerry walked the streets Tuesday where nearly 100 anti-government protesters were gunned down by police last month, and promised beseeching crowds that American aid is on the way.The Obama administration announced a $1 billion energy subsidy package in Washington as Kerry was arriving in Kyiv. The fast-moving developments came as the United States readied economic sanctions amid worries that Moscow was ready to stretch its military reach further into the mainland of the former Soviet republic.Putin dials down the tension in UkraineWhy the West may be powerless to stop PutinKerry headed straight to Institutska Street at the start of an hours-long visit intended to bolster the new government that took over just a week ago when Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych fled. He lay a bouquet of red roses, and twice the Roman Catholic secretary of state made the sign of the cross at a shrine set up to memorialize protesters who were killed during mid-February riots.“We're concerned very much. We hope for your help, we hope for your assistance,” a woman shouted as Kerry walked down a misty street lined with tires, plywood, barbed wire and other remnants of the barricades that protesters had stood up to try to keep Yanukovych's forces from reaching nearby Maidan Square, the heart of the demonstrations.Piles of flowers brought in honour of the dead provided splashes of colour in an otherwise drab day that was still tinged with the smell of smoke.The Ukraine government continued to grapple with a Russian military takeover of Crimea, a strategic, mostly pro-Russian region in the country's southeast, and Kerry's visit came as Russian President Vladimir Putin said he wouldn't be deterred by economic sanctions imposed punitively by the West.U.S. officials travelling with Kerry, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Obama administration is considering slapping Russia with unspecified economic sanctions as soon as this week. Members of Congress say they're preparing legislation that would impose sanctions as well.As Kerry arrived, the White House announced the package of energy aid, along with training for financial and election institutions and anti- corruption efforts. Additionally, the officials said, the U.S. has suspended what was described as a narrow set of discussions with Russia over a bilateral trade investment treaty. It is also going to provide technical advice to the Ukraine government about its trade rights with Russia. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to be quoted by name before the official announcement was made.Putin pulled his forces back from the Ukrainian border on Tuesday, yet said that Moscow reserves the right to use all means to protect Russians in the country. He accused the West of encouraging an “unconstitutional coup” in Ukraine and driving it onto anarchy, declaring that any sanctions the West places on Russia will backfire.In Washington, the White House said the $1 billion loan guarantee was aimed at helping insulate Ukraine from reductions in energy subsidies. Russia provides a substantial portion of Ukraine's natural gas and U.S. officials said they are prepared to work with Kyiv to reduce its dependence on those imports. The assistance is also meant to supplement a broader aid package from the International Monetary Fund.Clutching five red carnations, Svitlana Moherouska, an 18-year-old student at Kyiv National University, said Ukraine desperately needs economic aid to ensure its people continue to collect salaries. She said she joined in the protests, starting last November.“We come here to leave flowers and to walk the streets where there was a war,” she said. “It's very painful for us. It was hard for me to see how the police ran after our people. I hope it will be our victory and be a better life for us. But it will be very hard for us because the economy is very bad.”They cited reports of Russian helicopters nearly flying into mainland Ukraine airspace before being intercepted by jets controlled by Kyiv. It's believed as many as 16,000 Russian troops have deployed to Crimea, while Ukrainian forces are amassing on both sides of an isthmus separating the region's peninsula from the mainland.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				“I want you to know I do not underestimate the incredible pressure you all are under,” U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden told members of the Ukrainian parliament  Tuesday.
			The vice-president also announced the United States will provide an additional $50 million U.S. to help Ukraine’s beleaguered government with political and economic reforms.The money includes $11 million to help conduct the May 25 presidential election, including voter education, administration and oversight.The White House has also announced $8 million in non-lethal military assistance for the Ukrainian armed forces, including bomb-disposal equipment, communications gear and vehicles.Biden told Ukrainian political leaders that the United States stands with them against “humiliating threats” and encouraged them to root out corruption as they rebuild their government.In the most high-level visit of a U.S. official since crisis erupted in Ukraine, Biden told leaders from various political parties that he brings a message of support from President Barack Obama as they face a historic opportunity to usher in reforms.“The opportunity to generate a united Ukraine and getting it right is within your grasp,” Biden said. “And we want to be your partner and friend in the project. We’re ready to assist.”The vice-president’s visit comes at a critical time, days after a tenuous international agreement was reached to de-escalate violence in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russia insurgents oppose the government in Kyiv.Biden told the lawmakers a priority for the U.S. is to help them become independent from Russian energy supplies. Biden added, “You have to fight the cancer of corruption that is endemic in your system right now.” He mentioned cleaning up the court system and finding the right balance of power between the president and Rada.“I want you to know I do not underestimate the incredible pressure you all are under,” Biden said. “I do not underestimate the challenges you all face. And I do not underestimate the frustration you all must feel when someone like me comes along to say what a great opportunity this is for you all.”But he added that the upcoming election may be the most important in the country’s history. “The truth of the matter is your fellow countrymen expect a whole lot from you right now,” he said.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				Opposition supporters sing the Ukrainian national anthem during a rally in the Independence Square in Kiev, Ukraine, Sunday, Feb. 9, 2014. Ukraine’s security agency on Sunday warned of a heightened risk of terrorism, including from the anti-government protests.

			KIEV, UKRAINE—Ukraine’s security agency on Sunday warned of a heightened risk of terrorism, including from nearly three months of anti-government protests. The warning raised the pressure on the opposition as parliament tries to find a way out of the crisis.The Security Service of Ukraine said it was putting its counter-terrorism units on alert, after receiving a large number of bomb threats across the country at airports, train stations, pipelines and other locations. In what was seen as a warning to the opposition, the seizure of government buildings also would be viewed as manifestations of terrorism, the agency said in a statement.Some 30,000 people turned out for a rally on Kyiv’s Independence Square, known as the Maidan, on Sunday, the day the demonstrations usually draw the largest crowds.Opposition leaders demanded a constitutional reform that would reduce presidential powers and early elections in which they hope to unseat President Viktor Yanukovych. The measures are currently being discussed in the national parliament, which is controlled by Yanukovych loyalists who so far have rejected those demands.“The authorities are already scared of us,” opposition leader Oleh Tyahnybok told the crowd. “We need to press them further.”The protests started after Yanukovych ditched a key treaty with the European Union in favour of a bailout loan from Russia.“We are already tired of standing on the Maidan,” said Dmytro Shulets, 47. “Nothing happens without a fight. If talks fail, we will resort to force again.”Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…
				Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Deshchytsia smiles during a vote on the territorial integrity of Ukraine at United Nations headquarters, Thursday.
			The UN General Assembly approved a resolution Thursday affirming Ukraine’s territorial integrity and calling the referendum that led to Russia’s annexation of its Crimean Peninsula illegal.The vote on the Ukraine-sponsored resolution was 100 countries in favour, 11 opposed and 58 abstentions.The “yes” vote was higher than many diplomats had predicted, and the fact that more than half the 193 UN member states supported the resolution reflected widespread international opposition to Russia’s military intervention and takeover of the strategic Black Sea region.Unlike the more powerful Security Council, resolutions in the General Assembly cannot be vetoed but are not legally binding.Russia has blocked action in the Security Council where they have veto power as one its five permanent members. Even so, the 15-member council has held eight meetings on Ukraine, as Western powers strive to keep up the pressure on Moscow.Before the vote, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia told the assembly that his country’s territorial integrity and unity had been “ruthlessly trampled” by Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council entrusted to maintain international peace and security, and in direct violation of the UN Charter.“By voting in favour of this resolution you vote in favour of the UN Charter while voting against or abstaining equals undermining it,” Deshchytsia said in urging a “yes” vote.He called the resolution “confrontational in nature” and said it would be “counterproductive” to challenge the results of the referendum.Over the past week, Churkin mounted a campaign against the resolution, claiming the dispute is an East-West issue. Ukraine’s UN Ambassador Yuriy Sergeyev countered in meetings with regional groups that Russia violated the UN Charter and stressed that the country is not a member of any bloc.Crimea has been at the centre of Europe’s greatest geopolitical crisis since the end of the Cold War. Russian troops took over the Ukrainian peninsula, where Russia’s Black Sea fleet is based, and Moscow officially annexed Crimea following a referendum last week.The upheaval in Crimea is the fallout of months of anti-government protests and outbursts of violence that led to the ouster of Ukraine’s pro-Russia president, Viktor Yanukovych, who fled last month.The resolution adopted Thursday says the referendum on Crimea has “no validity” and calls on all countries and organizations not to recognize Russia’s annexation.It also calls on all parties to immediately pursue a peaceful resolution of the situation in Ukraine “through direct political dialogue.”Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…What's happens when men travel to meet Ukraine women?

			SEVASTOPOL, UKRAINE—Ukraine's acting government issued an arrest warrant Monday for President Viktor Yanukovych, accusing him of mass crimes against the protesters who stood up for months against his rule. Russia sharply questioned its authority, calling it an “armed mutiny.”Yanukovych himself has reportedly fled to the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, a pro-Russian area in Ukraine.Calls are mounting in Ukraine to put Yanukovych on trial, after a tumultuous presidency in which he amassed powers, enriched his allies and family and cracked down on protesters. Anger boiled over last week after government snipers killed scores of protesters in the bloodiest violence in Ukraine's post-Soviet history.The turmoil has turned this strategically located country of 46 million inside out over the past few days. The parliament speaker is now nominally in charge of a country whose ailing economy is on the brink of default and whose loyalties are sharply torn between Europe and longtime ruler Russia.Russia and the European Union appeared to be taking opposing sides in Ukraine's new political landscape.Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev questioned the legitimacy of the new Ukrainian authorities on Monday. According to Russian news agencies, he said the acting authorities have come to power as a result of an “armed mutiny,” so their legitimacy is causing “big doubts.”In Brussels, European Commission spokesman Olivier Bailly referred to parliament speaker Oleksandr Turchinov as the “interim president” and said Turchinov will meet with Monday visiting EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton in Kyiv.Ukraine's acting interior minister, Arsen Avakhov, said on his official Facebook page that a warrant has been issued for the arrest of Yanukovych and several other officials for the “mass killing of civilians.”Yanukovych set off a wave of protests by shelving an agreement with the European Union in November and turning instead for a $15 billion bailout loan from Russia. Within weeks, the protests expanded to include outrage over corruption and human rights abuses, leading to calls for Yanukovych's resignation.After signing an agreement Friday with the opposition to form a unity government, Yanukovych fled Kyiv for his pro-Russian power base in eastern Ukraine. Avakhov said he tried to fly out of Donetsk but was stopped then went to Crimea on Sunday.Security has been tightened across Ukraine's borders, the Interfax news agency quoted the State Border Guard service as saying.Avakhov published a letter that he said was from Yanukovych, dated Monday, in which he gave up his security guard. Yanukovych's aides and spokespeople could not be reached Monday to verify the reported letter — they have been rapidly distancing themselves from him as his hold on power disintegrates.“He must answer for all the crimes he has committed against Ukraine and its people,” he said, as thousands continued to flock to the area to light candles and lay flowers where dozens were shot dead during clashes with police last week. “Yanukovych must be tried by the court of the people right here in the square.”Tensions have been mounting in Crimea in southern Ukraine. Russia maintains a large naval base in Sevastopol that has strained relations between the countries for two decades.Pro-Russian protesters gathered in front of city hall in the port of Sevastopol on Monday chanting “Russia! Russia!”The head of the city administration in Sevastopol quit Monday amid the turmoil, and protesters replaced a Ukrainian flag near the city hall building with a Russian flag.Russian President Vladimir Putin's position on the turmoil in Ukraine will be crucial to the future of Crimea and to Ukraine. Putin spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel by telephone Sunday and the German government said the two agreed that Ukraine's “territorial integrity must be respected.”On Monday, German government spokesman Steffan Seibert told reporters that Ukraine's new leaders should consider the interests of the south and east — the pro-Russian sections of Ukraine — in the composition of a new government. He also said the offer of an association agreement with the EU is still on the table.As president, Yanukovych moved quickly to consolidate power and wealth, curb free speech and oversee the imprisonment of his top political rival, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. But as protesters took control of the capital over the weekend, many allies turned against him.Yet Yanukovych has proved politically resilient in the past. In Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution, when protesters pressed for democratic reforms, his fraud-ridden victory in presidential elections was overturned. He soon came back as prime minister and then was elected president in 2010, riding on a wave of popular disappointment in the squabbling Orange team.But Yanukovych's archrival Tymoshenko, the blond-braided heroine of the 2004 Orange Revolution, is back on the political scene after having been freed from prison.The current protest movement in Ukraine has been in large part a fight for the country's economic future — for better jobs and prosperity.Ukraine has struggled with corruption, bad government and short-sighted reliance on cheap gas from Russia. Political unrest has pushed up the deficit, sent the currency skidding and may have pushed the economy back into a recession.“The state treasury has been torn apart, the country has been brought to bankruptcy,” Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a protest leader and prominent lawmaker whose name is being floated as a possibility for prime minister, said in parliament Monday.Ukraine's acting finance minister said Monday that the country needs $35 billion (25.5 billion euros) to finance government needs this year and next and expressed hope that Europe or the United States would help. The minister, Yuri Kolobov, said Ukraine hopes for an emergency loan within the next two weeks and called for an international donors conference to discuss aid to Ukraine.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…
				A man who was recently injured in clashes during protests in Ukraine, looks on in Kyhiv's Independence Square  Tuesday. Ukraine's interim leader delayed the appointment of a new unity government until Feb. 27 as the country sought to find a way out of its most serious political crisis since independence.
			
  KYIV, UKRAINE—It is tough enough to tear down the old, far more difficult to build anew.

  That’s the riddle for every revolution. And the vexing reality of
  
    Ukraine
  
  today as it struggles precariously at the starting gate of Revolution Part II — the building phase — with a worsening financial crisis on its heels.

  Tuesday saw a false start — a two-day delay on the appointment of a
  
    new provisional governmen
  
  t — as Ukraine’s disparate opposition factions quarreled over their share of the void left by the collapsed regime of now-fugitive president Viktor Yanukovych.

  But the infighting came with a deepening sense that even if this fledgling exercise in state-building prevails, it may ultimately end in territorial partition, leaving a solvent but smaller Ukraine than the world has previously known.

  Ukraine’s interim president sounded the warning against separatism Tuesday, saying “threats to Ukraine’s territorial integrity” would not be tolerated.

  But at even greater risk is the southern Crimean peninsula — a jewel in the Gordian knot that is Ukraine — where a Russian-speaking majority is already demonstrating deep disdain as it watches the astonishing events in Kyiv from afar.

  Conquered by Catherine the Great in 1783 as the final piece in Russia’s absorption of Eastern Ukraine, the Crimea was at the centre of tensions Tuesday as a visiting Russian parliamentarian hinted at Russian intervention.

  “If the
  
    life and health of our compatriots is under threat
  
  , we will not stand to one side,” Leonid Slutsky, head of the Russian Duma’s committee for relations with former Soviet states, said upon arrival in the regional capital of Simferopol.

  Slutsky did not elaborate on what form of action Russia might take. Russian military vehicles, at least in small numbers, were deployed Tuesday in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, outside a leased base that is home to Russia’s Black Sea fleet, according to AFP.

  Mychailo Wynnyckyj, a Canadian-born associate professor of sociology at Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, said he was tentative hopeful that Ukraine’s eastern provinces would hold. But he is more deeply pessimistic about the prospects for Crimea remaining within the country.
Protesters removed a Soviet star from the top of the Ukrainian parliament building, as political tensions rise and economic challenges remain after the Russia-backed president went into hiding. (Feb. 25)
  “To put it in Canadian terms, it mirrors the Quebec question. Every Ukrainian I know wants Crimea to stay — but it’s their decision. And what we’re seeing there are pretty large scale demonstrations of people saying, ‘Look, we want to be different.’ They are not saying they want to be Russian, necessarily. They want a regional identity, a Crimean identity.”

  Beyond Crimea, Wynnyckyi said, Ukraine’s eastern Russian-leaning provinces may be satisfied with what he called an emerging consensus among Ukraine’s new leadership that decentralization of power could be the formula for neutralizing the separatist impulse.

  “Decentralization is on the table, it is part of the agenda. And if it is done properly, I think the danger of separation goes away as the eastern provinces take on a strong regional identity,” he said.

  “But if it is handled poorly and the regional demands are not heard, we still have to worry about how Russia itself plays its hand there. Because for (president
  
    Vladimir) Putin
  
  , this has been an absolute disaster — he worries now about the domino effect that this revolution could be exported to Moscow.

  “We are seeing Russians excited by the Ukrainian example and the Kremlin doesn’t like it. It is in the Kremlin’s interest to be able to show that Ukrainians are not happy with the results of the revolution, and it is in the Kremlin’s interest to do that sooner rather than later.”

  Such worries and suspicions about Russia’s next moves are widespread on Kyiv’s still-crowded Maidan, epicentre of the protests that ultimately toppled Yanukovych.

  But the suspicion flows both ways. Many Russian-speaking Ukrainians fear Western meddling every bit as much as Ukrainian nationalists fear Russia. And the Russian side here is especially incensed over the interim leadership’s restoration of Ukrainian as the country’s lone official language as its very first order of business.

  “This is about the people of Ukraine and Ukrainians making their choice about their future.”

  “I really think we have to credit the Ukrainian people themselves with resisting the attempt to overturn their democracy and to lead their country back into the past,” Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Tuesday after meeting with representatives of Canada’s Ukrainian community, the world’s largest Ukrainian diaspora.

				Pro-russian demonstrators in Simferopol  shout slogans on Feb. 27 in front of the Crimean parliament building, which has been taken over by armed men.
			Ukraine, now the epicentre of a tug-of-war between Russia and western powers, is teetering on economic ruin after the former president siphoned close to $70 billion from the country, the new prime minister says.Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told the Ukrainian parliament on Thursday that fugitive former president Viktor Yanukovych’s regime moved $70 billion out of Ukraine over the span of three years and that the nation’s treasury was almost empty — with only $40,000 in the bank and $15 billion in foreign reserves, reported the Kyiv Post.But if the money is in secret Swiss accounts, Yanukovych won’t be able to access it. The Swiss government on Friday claimed it would freeze all assets belonging to Yanukovych and members of his regime. While the bloodshed may have stopped in the capital of Kyiv, the world now watches as tensions heighten in Crimea, a largely ethnic-Russian region. Ukraine is calling Russian troop buildup along its eastern border a sign of aggression.A referendum on the region’s status in Ukraine will likely take place on May 25, lawmakers in Crimea’s regional parliament announced Thursday, according to Ukrainian and Russian news sources.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Thursday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who assured Kerry that Russia would respect Ukraine’s sovereignty. Lavrov described the troop movement as a previously scheduled military exercise.Canadian-Ukrainian Taras Zalusky, executive director of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, is travelling with Baird. Zalusky, who spoke to the Star early Friday, said emotions on the streets of Kyiv ranged from hope to tension, worry to excitement. “There are all of those emotions and still tremendous sorrow. You can’t speak to anyone, people that you run into — in the restaurant or wherever — who don’t talk about the tremendous sacrifice of the people who gave their lives,” he said.More than 80 died last week as the violence peaked in Kyiv. Police, under instructions from the Yanukovych government, opened fired on pro-EU demonstrators, who often fought back with Molotov cocktails and rocks. Zalusky said the Canadian delegation had a full schedule of meetings Friday with Maidan supporters, government leaders and various political party members.The financial situation in Ukraine is “very grave,” Zalusky added. The Russian government pulled the plug on a $15-billion emergency loan after the unrest began and the country owes money to Gazprom, the Russian supplier of Ukraine’s energy needs. “It makes sense for the West to support Ukraine with not only cash but a plan and a strategy to bring the country forward and go the full step, demonstrate a path to EU membership,” he said.“The country just has too much potential to fail. I don’t think the world community will let it happen,” he added. Keeping Ukraine united as a country of 46 million is now the main focus of the new Ukrainian parliament.“The issue now is national unity and anyone who calls for a split will act against Ukraine and its people. We face incredible economic challenges. The only way out is to do very unpopular things concerning tariffs, subsidies and social programs,” the 39-year-old Yatsenyuk said, according to the Kyiv Post.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

			MARIUPOL, UKRAINE—The turmoil in Ukraine dominated the European landscape Thursday, as three protesters were killed in a clash in southern Ukraine, high-level talks were held in Geneva and Vladimir Putin weighed in on his neighbour’s future for hours from Moscow.Still, the constellation of events left the nation of 46 million no closer to solving its essential challenge: the confrontation pitting Ukraine’s new government in Kyiv against a pro-Russian insurgency in its eastern regions that is being tacitly supported by Moscow.Three pro-Russian protesters were killed and 13 injured during an attempted raid overnight on a Ukrainian National Guard base in the Black Sea port of Mariupol, Ukraine’s authorities said Wednesday .The Interior Ministry said a mob of around 300 people armed with stun grenades and firebombs were involved in the bloodiest episode to date in the month-long insurgency.Masked and battle-ready militia bearing sophisticated firearms have been deeply involved in seizing government offices in eastern Ukraine, igniting suspicions that much of the unrest is being stirred with Russia’s backing.But in a four-hour televised question-and-answer session, Putin on Thursday dismissed as “nonsense” claims that Russian special forces were fomenting the unrest in eastern Ukraine.“It’s all nonsense, there are no Russian units, special forces or instructors in the east of Ukraine,” Putin said.He did admit — for the first time — that the troops in unmarked uniforms who had captured Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula before its annexation last month by Moscow were Russian soldiers.Putin also expressed hope that four-way talks between Ukraine, the U.S., the European Union and Russia in Geneva on Thursday could map a way out of one of Europe’s greatest security threats in decades.Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said shots fired by servicemen in the Mariupol base initially proved insufficient to deter the pro-Russian crowd from proceeding with their assault.There were no casualties among Ukrainian servicemen, the ministry said. At least 63 people involved in the attack were detained, but local media cited police as saying 38 were later released.The southern Ukrainian city lies on the road running from Russia along the coast to Crimea, the peninsula that Russia annexed last month. NATO says Russia has up to 40,000 troops along its border with Ukraine. If Russia was eyeing a possible “land bridge” from Russia to Crimea, it would need to take over the region that includes Mariupol.Speaking in parliament, acting President Oleksandr Turchynov said a pro-Russian gang carrying automatic weapons attempted to storm the base three times.APTN footage filmed outside the base on Wednesday night showed an unidentified man coming out to speak to masked men in the crowd armed with assault rifles. He told them the military had asked for 10 minutes to think over an unspecified ultimatum.The masked men insisted they wanted no bloodshed. A short while later, however, a crowd of mainly masked young men armed with bats and sticks began throwing Molotov cocktails at the base’s gate and at the trucks parked in front of it. Sounds of gunfire were heard in response.One soldier involved in the battle, a 20-year old conscript who gave his name only as Stanislav, said troops were forced to act in self-defence.“We were attacked by unidentified people and we didn’t want to shoot, but they were behaving aggressively,” he told the AP. “At first we fired in the air, but they continued advancing.”One protester admitted to a hospital with a bullet wound to the stomach said soldiers opened fire on them while they were attempting to force open the gates.“We just threw Molotov cocktails to light the way,” said Sergei Shevchenko, a 40-year-old businessman from the regional capital, Donetsk.Nearby residents were divided about the night’s events.“Russia isn’t just exporting oil and gas, but also terrorism,” said 43-year-old resident Yevgeny Nechiporenko. “This shooting and blood, the blood is on Russia’s hands.”Yet passers-by berated Nechiporenko as he spoke, with one accusing him of being an “agent of the West.”“We are willing to give up our lives so long as we don’t have to serve the fascists from Kyiv,” said resident Anna Govorko.The skirmish came after the government announced an operation to retake control of Slovyansk, a city close to the Russian border that has emerged as the focal point of the armed insurgency, and government buildings in several other cities in the east.Elsewhere in Mariupol, where pro-Russian protesters have been occupying city hall for nearly a week, 150 people rallied in front of the building, which is now encircled by barricades of tires and barbed wire.German Mandrakov, a pro-Russian protester who described himself as acting chief of the city council, said pro-Russian protesters went to the military base Wednesday evening to “convince them to switch to people’s side.”On Wednesday, hundreds of people in Kramatorsk, 15 kilometres south of Slovyansk, encircled a column of Ukrainian armoured vehicles carrying several dozen troops. Soon after, masked gunmen in combat gear arrived and Ukrainian soldiers surrendered the vehicles to them.Turchynov told parliament on Thursday the brigade that handed over its vehicles would be disbanded and its members put on trial.At another location near Kramatorsk, a crowd also surrounded troops on 15 Ukrainian armoured vehicles. To end the standoff, Ukrainian servicemen handed over the magazines from their assault rifles to pro-Russian militia. The infantry vehicles were allowed to return to their base in Dnipropetrovsk, 225 kilometres away.In Moscow, Putin denounced the Ukrainian authorities’ decision to use the military to uproot the protests in the east as a “grave crime.” He added he told his Western counterparts urging him to help disarm pro-Russian protesters that the Ukrainian government should first pull the army back.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…“I intend to keep fighting for the future of Ukraine,” he told a news conference Friday in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don. Yanukovych had not been seen since Saturday as he lost his grip on power.Yanukovych spoke in Russian during the press conference. A native Russian speaker, he would speak publicly in Ukrainian in Kyiv — although sometimes respond in Russian if asked a question in his mother tongue.Yanukovych insisted he “did not flee anywhere” but left for the city of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine. He said he was “forced” to leave the country when he was in Crimea after his family received threats. Asked how he managed to get to Russia, the fugitive president said he got out “thanks to patriotic officers who did their duty and helped me to save my life.”Yanukovych said he had not met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Russia but talked with him on the phone, adding that he hopes the Russian leader will find time to see him.The Ukrainian president lambasted the West for allegedly betraying a Feb. 21 compromise agreement between the government and the opposition, saying that recent actions by the opposition run counter to the EU-brokered pact.Yanukovych dismissed reports of opulence at a villa outside Kyiv, calling them “pretty pictures” and pledging to prove in court that the residence did not belong to him.Ukraine's Interior Minister said earlier Friday that Russian navy troops were blocking access to the airports in Simferopol and Sevastopol, describing it as a “military invasion and occupation.”But Ukraine's Security Council Chief Andriy Parubiy insisted later that the airports were still under Ukrainian control, according to the Interfax news agency.In Austria, meanwhile, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the country is freezing the bank accounts of Yanukovych, his son, Aleksander, and 16 others linked to Ukraine's former governmentMartin Weiss said the move is meant to ensure that no money is withdrawn from their accounts pending an EU-wide decision on whether Yanukovych and his closest associates should be put under financial and other sanctions.Weiss did not name those affected. Weiss also said Friday he could not speculate on how much money was in the frozen accounts.Authorities in Switzerland also announced Friday they have launched a corruption probe against Yanukovych and his son Aleksander, and blocked all the potential assets that might be hidden in the Alpine nation.The Geneva prosecutors' office said in a statement that the criminal investigation concerned “aggravated money laundering.”“Chief prosecutor Yves Bertossa and members of the financial police conducted a search in the morning of Feb. 27 at the premises of a company owned by Aleksander Yanukovych,” prosecutors said. Documents were seized, but the prosecutor said no further details of the investigation would be provided.Separately, the nation's governing Federal Council, which includes the president and six other ministers, said Friday it has decided to block all assets Yanukovych and his entourage might have in Switzerland, effective immediately.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				  Terms and Conditions.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…A medic for anti-government demonstrators in Kiev, Ukraine says three demonstrators died following overnight clashes with police. The medic says one demonstrator died after falling from a high place during the clashes. (Jan. 22)The protesters’ deaths, the first since the largely peaceful protests started in November, fuelled fears that the daily demonstrations — aimed at bringing down the government over human rights violations and its decision to shun the European Union for closer ties to Moscow — could turn more violent.With a central Kyiv street ablaze and clouded by thick black smoke from burning tires, and several thousand protesters continuing to clash with riot police, opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk urged demonstrators in a nearby square to refrain from violence and remain in the main protest camp for the next 24 hours. He demanded that Yanukovych dismiss the government, call early elections within 24 hours and scrap harsh anti-protest legislation. It was last week’s passage of laws cracking down on protests that set off the violent clashes.“You, Mr. President, have the opportunity to resolve this issue. Early elections will change the situation without bloodshed and we will do everything to achieve that,” Yatsenyuk told some 40,000 people who braved freezing temperatures on Kyiv’s Independence Square late Wednesday.If Yanukovych does not concede, he added, “Tomorrow we will go forward together. And if it’s a bullet in the forehead, then it’s a bullet in the forehead, but in an honest, fair and brave way.”Yanukovych showed little willingness to compromise. A three-hour meeting with opposition leaders accomplished “nothing,” said Oleh Tyahbnybok, who attended the session.Meanwhile, the government handed security forces extra powers, including closing off streets and firing water cannons against protesters despite the freezing temperatures. Police have already used water cannons but insisted it was only to put out fires. The government also deployed an armoured personnel carrier at the site of the clashes.Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said the police did not have live ammunition and that opposition leaders should be held responsible for the deaths.City health officials and police said that two people died of gunshot wounds during the clashes Wednesday morning, while the opposition contended as many as five people died. Oleh Musiy, co-ordinator of the protesters’ medical corps, told The Associated Press that four people died of gunshot wounds and the fifth died after falling from a colonnaded gate at a sports arena near the site of the clashes. Health officials contend that man survived and is in the hospital. Hundreds of others were injured in the clashes, Musiy said.The United States responded by revoking the visas of Ukrainian officials linked to violence and threatened more sanctions. But it also condemned the extreme-right radical protesters for their aggressive actions. The EU condemned the violence and said it was also considering action against the Ukrainian government.The mass protests erupted after Yanukovych spurned a pact with the European Union in favour of close ties with Russia, which offered him a $15-billion bailout. They swelled to hundreds of thousands after a small peaceful rally on Nov. 30 was violently broken up by police.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…
				Heavily armed soldiers displaying no identifying insignia maintain watch in a street in Simferopol on Saturday. Later in the day soldiers in the city began displaying Russian colours.
			SIMFEROPOL, UKRAINE—After three days of covert conquest by mysterious gunmen of no fixed address, Russian troops ended the pretense Saturday, completing the takeover of Crimea with their colours on their sleeves.As the insignia went on, the gloves came off, as truckloads of soldiers moved swiftly to claim total control of the semi-autonomous peninsula, Ukraine’s only province with a majority of citizens of Russian descent.A bloodless coup. A counter-revolution within a revolution. And, on the surface at least, a day of giddy liberation for pro-Russian Crimeans, who welcomed the occupation of their corner of Ukraine with flowers and cheers.“Russia! Russia!” was the fierce, echoing chant here in the regional capital of Simferopol, where a crowd of more than 1,000 marched in celebration. The Russian tricolour was everywhere, one flag so large it spanned the entire width of the street, held aloft by more than a dozen people.Why Ukraine is not the Cold War revisited: BurmanBy mid-afternoon, clusters of heavily armed soldiers could be seen in more than a dozen downtown locations — many, though not all, showing the blue, red and white stripes of Russia.The welcome was not unanimous. Simferopol, the travel gateway to Crimea’s coastal resorts, is two-thirds Russian. The remaining third — Ukrainians and Muslim Tatars with a five-century claim to the region — remained indoors, hunkered down in dread.The set-piece military operation in Crimea received the rapid endorsement of the Kremlin, where the Russian Parliament handed President Vladimir Putin “the full arsenal of means” to mobilize in Crimea, and possibly beyond to other parts of eastern and southern Ukraine with significant Russian populations.A diplomatic frenzy ensued, with Barack Obama and Putin spending 90 minutes on the phone Saturday, less than a day after the U.S. president warned “there will be costs” to direct military intervention in Ukraine.But amid expressions of deep concern from the UN, NATO, the EU and virtually every Western government, including Canada, there was no indication those costs would add up to military confrontation.In Kyiv, the interim Ukrainian leadership whose hold on power is less than a week old warned Russia it viewed the intervention as an act of war. (It put the military on high alert.) Moscow, for its part, did not return Kyiv’s calls.The developments came as grim reality for those citizens in Crimea who side with the fledgling Ukrainian revolution.“Imagine how you would feel if Great Britain popped out of nowhere to take away half the land of Canada,” Eugene Novitsky, leader of the EuroMaidan protests in Simferopol, remarked caustically to the Star.“We are dealing with one of the most powerful militaries in the world with our government at its most vulnerable — only days old and already confronting a terrible economic crisis,” said Novitsky. “Our Ukrainian units in Crimea are surrounded by Russian troops. We now face what feels like a permanent threat from the new imperialistic, chauvinistic Russia.”There is an ironic etymology to Crimea’s two most important cities. Simferopol, the capital, is based on the Greek world for “usefulness.” And Sebastopol, the coastal home of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, translates to “Emperorville.”Beyond Crimea, tense pro-Russian protests played out in eastern and southern Ukrainian cities of Donetsk, Kharkiv and Luhansk and the southern port of Odessa, some leading to scuffles with supporters of Ukraine’s new government.But the more immediate worries centred on Crimea, where any outbreak of violence involving Russian soldiers on the ground could come with ominous consequences.Refat Chubarov, head of Crimea’s 300,000-strong Tatar population, urged his people to stay home and not resist the Russians. In the Crimean port of Balaclava, local residents stood as human shields between Ukrainian and Russian armed personnel, according to a statement from the Ukrainian Border Guard Service. “The situation is tense to the limit.” Other reports late Saturday indicated the Ukrainian navy was removing its assets and personnel to Odessa, ceding its own ground to Russian forces in a bid to avoid bloodshed.Within Ukraine, a standoff of a political kind worsened, with Crimea’s newly created, pro-Russian government announcing it would move forward a planned referendum on greater autonomy, with the vote coming March 30 instead of May 25, when Ukraine is set for nationwide elections.Kyiv, meanwhile, announced the regional government was itself illegal, having been launched not only under gunpoint earlier this week but also without the necessary quorum of regional parliament.The lone glimmer in Saturday’s developments, albeit a dim one, was the announcement that former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was released from prison a week ago after the fall of Viktor Yanukovych’s regime, would travel to Moscow Monday to meet Putin.Tymoshenko, once regarded as a hero in Ukraine for co-leading 2004’s ultimately failed Orange Revolution, has a history of successfully managing the fraught relationship with Russia.But for many Ukrainians — perhaps even the vast majority — who endured three winter months in Kyiv’s Independence Square for a fresh start for Ukraine, Tymoshenko is now seen as every bit as inculcated in the culture of corruption as the now fugitive Yanukovych.For them, if the price of Tymoshenko solving the crisis with Russia is having to accept a new Tymoshenko government in Ukraine, the entire effort will have been for naught.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…
				People peer into the residency of the deposed Ukrainian president near Kyiv on Sunday. Thousands of Ukrainians continue to flock to the gargantuan residence, some 15 kilometres Kyiv, to wonder at the 140-hectare grounds, take in the gaudy mansions dripping in gold and marble, and marvel at the antelopes in the menagerie.
			These are some of the expenses detailed in financial documents found in President Viktor Yanukovych’s abandoned residence, which was occupied by protesters after the leader fled the capital.As thousands of Ukrainians continued to tour Yanukovych’s opulent estate outside of Kyiv on Sunday, evidence was uncovered of lavish spending in an economy that is teetering on the verge of default.Yanukovych left Kyiv on Friday night after opposition protesters took control of the capital and the national parliament in the wake of deadly clashes with police last week. More than 70 people were killed and hundreds were injured.Ukraine’s future hangs in the balancehile visitors gawked in awe and outrage at Yanukovych’s luxurious mansions, ponds and exotic animals, journalists combed through heaps of documents that appeared to show a leader who basked in extravagant wealth while his country sought bailouts from both the West and Russia.Many of the financial and other documents were burned, while others were dumped in a lake before Yanukovych fled his closely guarded residence, flying to the eastern city of Kharkiv, where his support base is strongest. Divers were able to retrieve many of the documents, and activists laid them out to dry.Photos of the documents were posted online by Mustafa Nayem, a top Ukrainian investigative journalist for the Ukrainska Pravda website and Hromadske.tv online news channel. Other respected Ukrainian news outlets also reported on the documents.One was a receipt for $12 million in cash. Another invoice was for a payment of $10 million. Some 80,000 euros (about $110,000) went for curtains in a room called the “knight’s hall.” Another 1.1 million euros (about $1.5 million) was spent on plants. Wooden decor for a handful of rooms cost $2.3 million.One page listed expenditures, and next to item No. 47 on the sheet was a payment of 32,580 hryvna (nearly $4,000) for what was described as a “bribe” used in a bidding process.Yanukovych’s whereabouts were unknown Sunday. An aide said she last spoke to him Saturday night and he considered himself the legitimate president of Ukraine and did not intend to leave the country.His residence in the Mezhygirya Park, about 140 hectares (345 acres) of forested hills along the Dnipro River had become for many Ukrainians a symbol of a corrupt administration. The president refused to answer questions about the estate, saying he lived in a modest house on a small plot of land on the grounds.Journalists’ investigations traced the property and buildings around it to Yanukovych’s allies.After Yanukovych’s departure from Kyiv, the estate was taken over by the opposition’s self-defence units, which opened it to visitors and deployed activists to maintain order and prevent any looting or property damage. Ukrainians, many bringing their children, rushed to tour the parks. They reacted with wonder and revulsion at the opulence, including Yanukovych’s private golf courses, pig farm and a small zoo with ostriches and peacocks.Some have called for turning the site into a hospital, sanatorium or even a “museum of corruption.”The Verkhovna Rada — Ukraine’s parliament that is now controlled by the opposition — voted Sunday to turn over control of the estate to the government.Yanukovych’s lifestyle was on the minds of some in the crowd of thousands who flocked Sunday to the epicenter of the protests in Kyiv’s central square, known as the Maidan. The people paid their respects to those demonstrators who died in the unrest.Yaryna Mosur, who left her two children in western Ukraine to take part in the protests, stood on the square wrapped in the Ukrainian flag as a black-robed Orthodox priest led prayers from a stage.She said she was infuriated by the wealth on display in Yanukovych’s estate.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…In a fast-moving day that could significantly shift Ukraine's political destiny, opposition leaders signed a deal Friday with the country's beleaguered president that calls for an early election, a new constitution and a new unity government.It is unclear if the fragile compromise signed by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and the opposition leaders to hold early elections and roll back the president’s powers will be enough to stop the bloodshed in Kyiv.The agreement, signed after 20 hours of tense negotiations, was brokered by the foreign ministers of Poland, France and Germany and it returns Ukraine to a balanced parliamentary-presidential republic. The Russian special envoy present for the negotiations refused to sign the deal as a witness. Once the compromise was signed, parliament voted to release former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, Yanukovych’s main political rival, who has been jailed since 2011 on what some called trumped-up political charges. The vote is veto-proof. It is unclear when she’ll actually be released.Nearly 100 demonstrators and police officers died during intense fighting in Kyiv’s Independence Square since Monday. It was the worst political crisis Ukraine has faced since post-Soviet times. In a move that stunned western democracies, government forces were authorized to use live ammunition and lethal weapons against the pro-European Union demonstrators who had barricaded themselves in a tent city inside the square for the last three months.The medieval-looking barricades — made of old tires, wood, bricks and scrap metal — were still up in the square on Friday as the coffins of demonstrators who died while fighting government forces were carried throughout the square on the shoulders of Euromaidan supporters, to the cries of “Heroes!” Euromaidan is name demonstrators christened the movement to restore democracy to Ukraine. Funerals will be held Saturday.The square was alight with candles and brightly lit mobile phones as the coffins were brought on stage. Opposition leaders were booed by the crowd as they also took to the stage to announce the results of the negotiations and kneel before the dead, according to Euromaidan’s public relations website. The political crisis erupted after Yanukovych suddenly turned away from approving a deal to form greater ties with the EU on Nov. 21. Instead, Yanukovych pivoted towards Russia, accepting a $15-billion loan and cheaper fuel prices from President Vladimir Putin’s government. Ukraine has only received $3 billion of that money and the rest is being held back pending the outcome of the crisis.Ukraine is a nation divided. The central-west half of the country aligns itself more with the dreams and aspirations of the EU and fears the return of Russian influence after the nation became an independent state in 1991. The eastern side has a large Russian-speaking population and had been supportive of Yanukovych. However, the country was largely united in believing force should not be used on demonstrators. While interior ministry troops have retreated, opposition members say Euromaidan demonstrators are remaining in the square as an “insurance policy” to make sure the agreement is honoured.The compromise ensures Ukrainian elections will be held no later than December 2014, as soon as a new constitution is adopted, and an amnesty has been granted to all protest participants. An investigation into recent acts of violence will be conducted jointly by authorities, the opposition and the Council of Europe. All victims of violence and their families will be financially compensated.Opposition leader Vitali Klitschko and Yanukovych sombrely shook hands after the deal was signed. The opposition has agreed to refrain from violence and the authorities countered that with a promise not to impose a state of emergency. “If you don’t support this deal, you’ll have martial law, the army. You’ll be dead,” Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski told an opposition leader during the negotiations, the Guardian reported. Euromaidan demonstrators in the square remain steadfast that they won’t leave until Yanukovych resigns.European Council President Herman Van Rompuy called the agreement a “necessary compromise,” Reuters reported.U.S. President Barack Obama and Putin spoke about the agreement on Friday and praised the compromise. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said the agreement is consistent with what the U.S. has advocated and that now the focus must be on “concrete action” to implement it.Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s office said in a release on Friday they “welcome news of the agreement between the Yanukovych regime and the opposition. But we will judge actions not words.”The Canadian embassy in Kyiv, closed earlier this week due to the unrest, remains shut. Canada will follow through on promised sanctions, including the “implementation of asset freezes should events on the ground necessitate additional measures,” the statement said.Travel restrictions against senior figures in the Yanukovych regime will remain, the statement said.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				In his first public appearance since fleeing to Russia, deposed Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych insisted Friday in that he had not been overthrown and would continue to fight for the future of Ukraine.
			If ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych wrapped himself in the flag, it would be an uncomfortable fit.He’s wanted in the country he recently led for the mass murder of protesters, and may soon be charged with financial crimes after the alleged theft of some $70 billion from the national treasury.But on Friday, in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, a soberly clad Yanukovych merely sat in front of the Ukrainian standard and reviled Ukraine’s new interim government, while calling on Moscow to refrain from military intervention in the increasingly turbulent Black Sea Crimea region — and contrarily, insisting that his Russian host. Vladimir Putin. “should and must act” to end the political chaos.For Yanukovych, his post-presidential debut was both uneasy and reassuring, the latter an attempt to claw back some legitimacy in a friendly country after a manhunt targeting him as a bloodstained fugitive. But the chosen location, a provincial southern city, was symbolic of the distance that Putin wants between himself and Yanukovych.“(Putin) won’t let him go although he finds him a particularly stupid client,” says Mark Galeotti, a professor of global affairs at New York University, speaking from Moscow. “It would send the wrong signal. It’s in Russia’s interest not to try and reinstall Yanukovych, just to keep him quiet and out of the hands of any court.”Yanukovych is also a convenient “trump card” for Putin, says Russia expert Piotr Dutkiewicz of Carleton University. “The Western media take the line that Putin lost in Ukraine,” he says. “It’s quite the opposite. He now has completely free hands. He’s not putting more money into that corrupt regime, he’s no longer responsible for its government and he can renegotiate new terms for relations with Ukraine that he could never do before. It’s a strategic victory.”Yanukovych’s presence, says Dutkiewicz, can be used as a reminder that Russia does not believe in the legitimacy of the new government, which cannot survive without Russian trade and financial help.Yanukovych’s speech — carried live on the state channel Russia-24 — was, in fact, from the same playbook as Moscow’s blistering comments on Ukraine’s uprising. He blamed the West for failing to rein in the clashes in Russian-speaking Crimea and eastern Ukraine, condemned the European Union and Washington for staging his overthrow, and accused the protesters of banditry and violence against “absolutely innocent people.”Meanwhile, reports BBC, Russian MPs in the pro-Kremlin A Just Russia party tabled bills that would make it easier for Russia to swallow parts of Ukraine and fast-track Russian citizenship — an obvious reference to Crimea, where many in the 60 per cent Russian majority favour independence from Ukraine, if not formal union with Russia, which cast them off in 1954.What neither Yanukovych nor Putin have discussed is the end game, now in the hands of Russia.“The Duma’s actions aren’t helpful,” says Moscow security expert Andrei Soldatov, co-author of The New Nobility. “It’s a provocation. It’s a (legalized) show of force that says, ‘We don’t want to do this, but we have the option.’ But the radicalized people in Crimea could use it for their own ends.”Ukraine’s upheaval also has serious consequences for Russia, Soldatov said. “Society is divided. What happened in Ukraine was a useful tool for Russian propaganda. ‘If there’s any protest movement here it will be like 1917, with blood in the streets.’ People are unhappy here for lots of reasons, political and economic. It’s a convenient way of channelling aggression.”With files from the Star’s news servicesEmotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…
				A Russian navy ship sails Friday to Sevastopol. Stephen Harper describes Russia’s invasion of the region as a clear violation both of Ukraine’s sovereignty and international law.
			MONTREAL—Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird says Canada will suspend practically all its military relations with Russia because of the crisis in Ukraine.Baird is also confirming that the federal government will expel nine Russian soldiers who are training in Canada.Baird was speaking in Montreal after meeting with members of the city’s Ukrainian community.He made the comments shortly after Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced the imposition of travel bans to Canada for individuals connected with the crisis.Harper said in a statement the ban will affect individuals “responsible for threatening the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.”The prime minister did not identity the individuals in the release or indicate whether they had applied for travel to Canada or were regular visitors to Canada.The statement said the ban was to protest Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.The Conservative government has said the Crimea region of Ukraine is under “illegal military occupation” and that Canada will not recognize its forthcoming referendum on whether to join Russia.Lawmakers in Crimea have voted unanimously to split from Ukraine and join Russia, and will hold a referendum March 16 to allow voters on the disputed peninsula to weigh in on the decision.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				Protesters carry the coffin of Mikhail Zhiznevsky, 25, one of two protesters who died of gunshot wounds last week, during a memorial march in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Sunday.
			KYIV, UKRAINE—Thousands of Ukrainians chanted “Hero!” and sang the national anthem on Sunday, as a coffin carrying a protester who was killed in last week’s clashes with police was carried through the streets of the capital, underscoring the rising tensions in the country’s two-month political crisis.The opposition contends that Zhiznevsky and another activist were shot by police in an area where demonstrators had been throwing rocks and firebombs at riot police for several days. The government claims the two demonstrators were killed with hunting rifles, which they say police do not carry. The authorities would not say how the third protester died.Meanwhile, protests against President Viktor Yanukovych continued to engulf the country, now beginning to spread to central and eastern Ukraine, the leader’s support base.In Dnipropetrovsk, 390 kilometres southeast of Kyiv on the Dnipro River, several hundred demonstrators tried to storm a local administration building, but police drove them back with water sprayed from a fire truck in sub-freezing temperatures, the Interfax news agency reported. In Zaporozhets, about 70 kilometres down river, demonstrators gathered outside the city administration building.The protests began in late November after Yanukovych shelved a long-awaited agreement to deepen ties with the European Union, but they have been increasingly gripped by people seeking more radical action, even as moderate opposition leaders have pleaded for the violence to end.Zhiznevsky’s body was carried several hundred metres to Independence Square in central Kyiv, where protesters have established a large tent camp and held demonstrations around the clock since early December. Crowds shouted “Yanukovych is a murderer!” and “Down with the criminal,” a reference to Yanukovych’s run-ins with the law during his youth. The coffin was then carried to the site of Zhiznevsky’s death at barricades near the Ukrainian Parliament.A crowd late Saturday besieged a building, throwing fireworks, firebombs and rocks, near the protest tent camp where about 200 police were sheltering. By early Sunday morning, a corridor was created, allowing police to leave.On Sunday, activists were cleaning up the devastated Ukrainian House building, sweeping broken glass and furniture, but also the trash left there by police.The overnight outburst came soon after opposition leaders issued a defiant response to Yanukovych’s offer to make Arseniy Yatsenyuk, one of their top figures, the country’s prime minister. While not rejecting the offer outright, Yatsenyuk said more of the opposition’s demands must be met, including Yanukovych’s resignation. He vowed protests will continue.About half of Ukraine’s people favoured deeper integration with the EU, according to polls, and many Ukrainians widely resent Russia’s long influence over the country.In the past week, demonstrators have seized government administration buildings in a score of cities in western Ukraine, where Yanukovych’s support is weak and desire for European ties is strong.Despite an offer to release activists and stop more persecutions, the government continued a crackdown, with more than 40 detained in the central city of Cherkasy after a protest, according to prosecutorsEmotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…
				Pope Francis greets the faithful as he holds Easter Mass in St. Peter's Square.
			VATICAN CITY—Marking Christianity’s most hopeful day, Pope Francis made an Easter Sunday plea for peace and dialogue in Ukraine and Syria, for an end to terrorist attacks against Christians in Nigeria and for more attention to the hungry and neediest close to home.Well over 150,000 tourists — Romans and pilgrims, young and old — turned out for the Mass that Francis celebrated at an altar set up under a canopy on the steps of St. Peter’s Basilica.So great were their numbers that they overflowed from sprawling St. Peter’s Square, which was bedecked with row after row of potted daffodils, sprays of blue hyacinths and bunches of white roses. Waving flags from the pope’s native Argentina as well as from Brazil, Mexico, Britain, Poland and many other countries, they also filled the broad boulevard leading from the square to the Tiber River.Easter Sunday celebrations around the worldEaster is the culmination of Holy Week and marks Christian belief that Jesus rose from the dead after his crucifixion.Francis noted that this year the Catholic church’s celebration of Easter coincided with that of Orthodox churches, which have many followers in Ukraine.Francis prayed that God would “enlighten and inspire the initiatives that promote peace in Ukraine, so that all those involved, with the support of the international community, will make every effort to prevent violence.”In eastern Ukraine, the holiday was marred by a deadly shooting Sunday fueled by tensions between pro-Russian supporters in the east and those loyal to an interim government in Kyiv. The clash appeared to defy an international agreement reached last week in hopes of ending months of unrest.Francis also prayed that all sides in Syria will be moved to “boldly negotiate the peace long awaited and long overdue.” Syria has been wracked by a three-year civil war that has cost 150,000 lives and forced millions to flee the country.Christians make up about 5 per cent of Syria’s population. In comments to mark Easter there, the Greek Orthodox patriarch vowed that Christians there “will not submit” to extremists who attack “our people and holy places.”Francis makes a pilgrimage to Jordan, the Palestinian territories and Israel next month, so on Easter he prayed that hopes sparked by the resumption of Mideast peace negotiations will be sustained.Thousands of pilgrims from around the world flocked to the celebrate Easter in the Holy Land, where Christian communities, as well as elsewhere in the Middle East, have been declining as the faithful flee regional turmoil.Nigerians marked Easter with heightened security against a spreading Islamic uprising, mourning the deaths of 75 bomb blast victims and fearful of the fate of 85 abducted schoolgirls. The homegrown terror network Boko Haram has claimed responsibility for last week’s rush-hour explosion in the capital, Abuja, and threatened more attacks.
      Well over 150,000 tourists — Romans and pilgrims, young and old — turned out for the Mass that Francis celebrated at an altar set up under a canopy on the steps of St. Peter’s Basilica.


    In Venezuela, there have been hopes Vatican mediation can help end the country’s violent political unrest, and Francis urged that “hearts be turned to reconciliation and fraternal concord” there.But Francis’ Easter message also urged people to pay attention to the needy close to home. He said the “good news” of Easter’s joy means “leaving ourselves behind and encountering others, being close to those crushed by life’s troubles, sharing with the needy, standing at the side of the sick, elderly and the outcast.”He denounced the “scourge of hunger,” which he said was “aggravated by conflicts and by the immense wastefulness for which we are often responsible.”Francis has set an austere tone in his papacy, forsaking an ornate apostolic palace apartment for a simple guesthouse on the Vatican grounds and rejecting limousines for regular cars.Cheering and applauding, the crowd tried to catch a glimpse of the pontiff as he circled around in his white popemobile before going to the basilica’s balcony to deliver his commentary.Reflecting the worldwide reach of the Catholic church, faithful read aloud prayers and passages from the Bible in Hindi, French, Chinese, German, Korean, Spanish, Italian and English.

				Vacheslav Ponomarev, the self-proclaimed mayor of Slovyansk, right, speaks to a pro-Russian gunman as two foreign military observers watch during a news conference in  Slovyansk, eastern Ukraine, on Sunday.
			SLOVYANSK, UKRAINE—Pro-Russian militants in camouflage fatigues and black balaclavas paraded captive European military observers before the media on Sunday, hours after three captured Ukrainian security guards were shown bloodied, blindfolded and stripped of their trousers and shoes, their arms bound with packing tape.The provocative displays came as the increasingly ruthless pro-Russian insurgency in the east turns to kidnapping as an ominous new tactic.Dozens of people are being held hostage, including journalists and pro-Ukraine activists, in makeshift jails in Slovyansk, the heart of the separatists’ territory, as the pro-Russian insurgents strengthen their control in defiance of the interim government in Kyiv and its Western supporters.Speaking in deliberate and clipped phrases, Col. Axel Schneider of Germany, speaking on behalf of the observers, insisted they were not NATO spies, as claimed by the insurgents, but a military observation mission operating under the auspices of the Organization of Security and Co-operation in Europe.Later in the day, pro-Russia activists took control of the state TV centre in Donetsk, the regional capital, without firing a shot. Members of a separatist movement called the Donetsk People’s Republic, aided by a fight club from the eastern city of Kharkiv, stormed the broadcast facility, saying they were sick of watching news aired through the prism of their enemies in Kyiv and demanding an undiluted stream of Russian programming.The day’s events showed eastern Ukraine slipping further into chaos, with armed separatists openly defying state authority and local police either folding in sympathy or admitting that they felt too intimidated to stop the pro-Russia groups.There was no sign of the new government in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, pressing ahead with its “anti-terror” police and military operation to retake buildings and checkpoints in the east occupied by pro-Russia militants.As Moscow and Washington traded blame for a failure to halt the escalation in tension, diplomats moved to try to free the hapless European military monitors.There were reports of vehicles being carjacked by pro-Russia activists and of a list circulating at anti-Kyiv checkpoints with the photographs of 18 journalists to be arrested on the spot.The Security Service of Ukraine said that three of its officers were captured by pro-Russia militants in the city of Horlivka, where the agents were investigating the recent torture and killing of a local politician and a university student. Both men were supporters of a unified Ukraine. Their bodies were found dumped in the river near Slovyansk.Sunday’s incidents occurred as Western nations prepared to impose fresh sanctions on Russia. Tony Blinken, the White House deputy national security adviser, said on CBS’s Face the Nation that the new measures would be aimed at members of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle, as well as “companies that they and other inner-circle people control.”The European Union is also expected to announce new measures Monday, though Europe has generally been more hesitant than the United States to punish Russia.German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the parading of the military officers before the news media was “repulsive” and “a breach of all the rules.” He appealed to Russia to pressure the separatists to free the monitors, who were arrested alongside five Ukrainian military officers and a driver.Late Sunday, one of the monitors was released into the custody of international negotiators, according to Michael Bociurkiw, an OSCE spokesman. The freed observer was from Sweden and was probably released because he has a serious pre-existing medical condition, the spokesman said.Support for the separatists in southeastern Ukraine is thin. The government buildings they occupy in towns and cities across the region are often defended by no more than a few dozen protesters, and they have had trouble drawing large crowds.Polls suggest that most people in the region, while favouring greater autonomy, do not want to be absorbed by Russia.Only a few hundred demonstrators turned out for a rally in Donetsk’s Lenin Square on Sunday, despite nearly ideal spring weather and the promise of an appearance by the mysterious “people’s governor.”The crowd, waving Russian and Donetsk People’s Republic flags, offered tepid applause as speaker after speaker railed against the “fascist government in Kyiv.”“I want to strangle a fascist with my bare hands,” shouted a woman who took the stage beneath a massive black stone statue of Lenin.Another speaker chided the leaders of the Donetsk People’s Republic for not being more aggressive in attacking the Ukrainian authorities and achieving autonomy. The power to his microphone was cut off mid-sentence, and men wearing camouflage uniforms and balaclavas escorted him from the stage.The self-appointed “people’s governor,” Denis Pushilin, told the crowd that his organization planned to stage a referendum May 11 on a single question: “Do you recognize the creation of the Donetsk People’s Republic?”If the answer is “yes,” Pushilin said, residents will decide whether to remain autonomous or join a neighbouring state, which could only be Russia, which annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea last month.Boris Litvinov, who is organizing the referendum, said the ballots had gone to the printers. But he conceded that the election faced logistic, political and legal hurdles. Only two cities are working closely with the group — “and half of Kramatorsk,” another city, he said.As separatists stormed the TV station, pro-unity Ukrainians gathered at a Donetsk cultural centre to hear from dissident Russian businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky.Khodorkovsky urged the Ukrainian audience, which included prominent Donetsk civic leaders, to demonstrate for Putin the cost of an invasion.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…
				Danylo Lubkivsky, Ukraine's deputy foreign minister, speaks to the media at the United Nations in New York on Friday. “We are going to protect our motherland against any invasion,” Lubkivsky said.
			Danylo Lubkivsky told reporters at the United Nations on Friday: “We have the information we are in danger.”He spoke as an official in Ukraine confirmed that pro-Russian forces had detained a team of military observers with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.Tensions have spiked as Russia increases military exercises along the Ukraine border. Lubkivsky called it a “very dangerous development” and demanded that Russia withdraw its troops.“We are going to protect our motherland against any invasion,” Lubkivsky said. “We call on the Russians to stop this madness.”Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the UN secretary-general, told reporters earlier Friday that Ban Ki-moon had been reaching out to both countries.“I think we all have to realize here that the stakes are extremely high, with potential negative implications for peace and security that extend far beyond the eastern Ukrainian cities,” Dujarric said. “It would be a grave mistake in the secretary-general’s views for any party to turn to military means in an attempt to resolve political issues that can and must be addressed by peaceful means.”Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…Cheap, shabby Tory politics. That’s the best that can be said about Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s cynical decision to show the Canadian flag in Ukraine this week by sending a nakedly partisan delegation that includes a Conservative cabinet minister, an unelected Tory senator and two Tory backbench MPs – but not a single representative of the opposition parties.It’s appalling to see the Conservatives exploit Ukraine’s national struggle for their own narrow interest.This petty politicking is an insult to Canadians of every stripe who have been cheering on Ukraine’s reformers, through some dark days. With the Harperites, partisan domestic politics doesn’t end at the water’s edge. In this government’s relentless jockeying for political advantage it never ends at all.After shamelessly courting Canada’s Jewish vote with his “million-dollar shot” photo op in Israel last month, with nary an Arab in his bloated 200-member delegation, Harper is at it again, trying to soak up the Canadian/Ukrainian vote. He has sent a Conservative mission to Ukraine, not a Canadian mission. These lopsided jaunts are an affront to the intelligence not only of Jewish and Ukrainian voters, but also to that of the wider electorate.Canadians expect their government to champion the national interest abroad, not to advance narrow party interests. As they cobble together a fragile new regime under interim President Oleksandr Turchinov and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, with Russian President Vladimir Putin breathing down their necks, Ukrainians deserve to know they have broad support from Canada’s Parliament, representing the Canadian people, not just from the government of the day and its partisans. As it happens, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau is a more trusted figure in Canadian eyes than Harper at the moment, and his party is ahead in the polls. Apart from hearing from Foreign Minister John Baird, Tory Senator Raynell Andreychuk and Tory backbench MPs Ted Opitz and James Bezan — plus four prominent Canadian/Ukrainian leaders — the new government in Kyiv might have welcomed an accompanying nod of support from Opposition Leader Tom Mulcair’s New Democrats and the Liberals. Together these two parties represent nearly 60 per cent of the electorate according to one recent poll. And both had asked to be included on the trip. Under past prime ministers they no doubt would have been. Why not? For reasons that have plenty to do with Tory interests and not much to do with anything else. In a brainless moment on television Trudeau made a flippant joke (for which he apologized, repeatedly) about Russia venting its Olympic hockey frustration on Ukraine. And the NDP’s Paul Dewar had the temerity to criticize Baird for joining protesters on the streets of Kyiv on an earlier trip. As a consequence of Trudeau’s gaffe the Liberals deserved to have “no role” in the mission, Harper’s spokesman said, and because the NDP “wouldn’t pick a side” they didn’t merit a spot either.Granted, Trudeau and Dewar both pooched the Ukraine file, at least fleetingly. Even so, plenty of other opposition MPs could have been included on the mission. If Harper banned every Tory cabinet minister who made a dumb remark or who disagreed with him from flying on the government jet, he’d be making a lot of lonely flights. His rationale for excluding the opposition has nothing to do with policy on Ukraine and everything to do with seeking political advantage.At root, Harper’s hyper-partisanship is an abuse of his high office, and of the public trust. It is unworthy of a Canadian prime minister, inimical to Canada’s national interests and a discredit to his party. We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

					STOCKHOLM—After the Cold War, Sweden refocused its national security strategy to give more weight to deployments in faraway conflict zones and even non-military challenges such as climate change. Critics who dwelled on a Russian threat were dismissed as dinosaurs.Russia’s readiness to use military force in Ukraine has been a wake-up call for many European countries that slashed defence spending after the fall of the Iron Curtain. “If we don’t do something quickly about it, some of our capabilities will be degraded to such an extent that they cease to exist,” Czech armed forces chief Petr Pavel warned last week at a conference marking the 15th anniversary of his country’s entry into NATO.Only a handful of NATO’s European members meet the alliance’s goal of spending 2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence. Meanwhile, Moscow spends more than 4 per cent of GDP on its military.Strained by the financial crisis, European defence budgets dropped even as Russia resumed muscle-flexing exercises and patrols near European borders, including the resumption of long-range strategic bomber flights in 2007. Although Russia’s brief war with Georgia in 2008 was a warning, Russia’s buildup was widely seen as just modernizing military forces that had fallen into disrepair.“I think a lot of people did underestimate the willingness of Russia to actually use them,” said Samuel Perlo-Freeman, a global military spending analyst at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.He said it’s very likely that Moscow’s assertiveness in the Ukraine crisis will prompt an increase in military budgets in countries near or bordering Russia in Central Europe and around the Baltic Sea.There are signs of that already. The Czech defence minister recently called for raising military spending to 1.5 per cent of GDP, although there’s no concrete budget proposal yet. Such outlays are down to 1.1 per cent after a series of cuts that military officials say have eroded the country’s military readiness.Lithuania spends less than 1 per cent of its output on the military but plans to ramp that up now, although “it is unrealistic that Lithuania will reach (NATO’S) 2 per cent objective in the short run,” Finance Minister Rimantas Sadzius said this month.Officials in Lithuania and Baltic neighbours Estonia and Latvia have called on NATO to move more resources there, including ground troops and missile defences. The U.S.-led alliance has boosted its air patrols over the Baltic countries and France offered Friday to add four more fighter jets.The three former Soviet republics have a history of quarrels with Moscow over the situation of Russian-speaking minorities in their countries. Russian President Vladimir Putin cited protecting Russians as the reason for seizing Crimea from Ukraine, and for fighting Georgia in 2008.In Sweden — which is not a NATO member and therefore has no guarantees that anyone will come to its aid in a conflict — the Ukraine crisis has triggered nervous discussions about the state of the country’s armed forces.At the height of the Cold War, neutral Sweden had some 400 fighter jets — four times more than today — and an ability to mobilize nearly 1 million troops. Now there are fewer than 20,000 personnel in active service.After the Soviet collapse, Sweden’s emphasis shifted toward nimbler, specialized units designed to join international coalitions in peacekeeping operations overseas. The defence budget was slashed by both left and right-leaning governments and military bases were closed. In 2010, Sweden abolished mandatory conscription.Two years later Sweden’s supreme commander made the startling assessment that the armed forces could defend the country’s borders for no more than a week.Now, both the left-leaning opposition and the centre-right government suddenly agree that Sweden’s military readiness is inadequate, with Finance Minister Anders Borg this week calling for “a substantial scaling-up” of capabilities.Neighbouring Finland has maintained a more “realistic” outlook toward Russia, with which it shares a 1,300-kilometre border, said Charly Salonius-Pasternak, a researcher at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.Finland has kept a strong line of defence toward the east, and maintained annual conscription of about 25,000 soldiers, in addition to 14,500 permanent defence personnel.“In the post-Cold War euphoria that gripped Europe,” he said, “the Finnish military, the political establishment and the population that supports it did not dramatically change its view of what is the potential existential threat to Finland: Russia.”Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…

				A masked pro-Russian insurgent looks through a window of the regional administration building in Donetsk, Ukraine, on Friday.
			DONETSK, UKRAINE—The mob has left the airport. But elsewhere in Donetsk, the tidings were grim for a deal to end the chaos in Ukraine, as pro-Russian militants dug in, refusing to disarm despite a flurry of political concessions.This eastern provincial capital has been the epicentre of a shrinking Ukraine’s latest anxieties, as the Moscow-backed paramilitary pattern that saw Crimea slip away unfolds anew.Talk of rapprochement appeared to gain heft Thursday, with Russia, the United States, the European Union and Ukraine striking an agreement in Geneva for the disarmament of militias and surrender of government buildings to state authority.Adding to the momentum on Friday, Ukraine’s fragile new leadership in Kyiv made overtures to the Russian-leaning eastern provinces, saying the Ukrainian government is “ready to conduct a comprehensive constitutional reform” to give the regions stronger local autonomy and establish “a special status to the Russian language,” ensuring the rights of all citizens.But the armed insurgents who hold sway on the ground turned aside the text from Geneva and the goodwill gestures from Kyiv. Instead, they seized Seversk, 100 km north of Donetsk, raising their holding of cities and towns in the self-proclaimed name of the People’s Republic of Donetsk to nearly a dozen.Denis Pushilin, speaking for the insurgents from the province’s occupied regional headquarters, told reporters the gunmen would remain until Kyiv’s new rulers step down.“As far as disarmament goes, the Kyiv junta has already begun violating its agreements since yesterday, by announcing that it will not pull its troops out of Solvyansk and Kramatorsk,” said Pushilin. Those towns were the initial targets of a delicate Ukrainian military effort to retake the east that now appears stalled.The lone point of improvement came at Donetsk airport, which was operating smoothly, albeit quietly, Friday, after being stormed one day earlier by pro-Russian separatists demanding the right to check incoming passengers.Reports of Ukrainian TV signals being removed from local broadcasts in some of the occupied towns added to the anxieties of Ukrainians who worry a slow-motion repeat of Crimea is playing out.Others on the streets of Donetsk echo the concussive message of Russian state-controlled media, saying the chaos is an inevitable result of the “fascist overthrow of our former government in Kyiv.“They are fascists and they hate Russian speakers,” Vaslav Bobrov, 32, a coal miner, told the Star. “We used to get along in the 20th century, Russians and Ukrainians together. But now I want Donetsk to join Russia. If we cannot do that, let’s at least have a federation so the power of Donetsk will be in Donetsk. I’m prepared to die for this.”Former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko — now a candidate for president of Ukraine — placed herself in the centre of the volatility Friday, arriving in Donetsk to hear firsthand what the insurgents want.“I’d like to listen to these demands by myself and find out how serious they are, so that one could find the necessary compromise between the east and the west that will allow us to unite the country,” she said.Tymoshenko remains a divisive figure for many in Ukraine. Once an iconic leader of the Orange Revolution, her leadership and the promise of that decade-old movement eventually collapsed amid allegations of corruption. In mounting a second revolution, many activists in Kyiv’s Independence Square, or Maidan, spoke of “lustration” — forbidding the return to power of all who held it before, including Tymoshenko. That impulse is one of the driving forces behind the flat refusal of the protest encampment in Kyiv to pack up and leave until a new elected government takes power.Yet Tymoshenko also has the ear of many foreign governments — and a history of striking deals with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In the vacuum Ukraine now finds itself as it hurtles toward May 25 elections, it remains to be seen whether voters are prepared to give her yet another chance.During her visit to Donetsk, Tymoshenko made a point of speaking in Russian, emphasizing that reforms she envisions would promote local self-government and give the Russian language “a stronger status” in Ukraine.But her message came replete with tough talk about the likely outcome, should Russia not act to contain the pro-Moscow insurgents. A third wave of international sanctions against the Kremlin, she said, could come as early as next Thursday, if the letter of the Geneva agreement fails to play out on the ground.Earlier this week, Tymoshenko called for the creation of local armed militias to counter the pro-Russian insurgency, saying that Ukraine’s depleted military alone is not up for the fight. During her visit here Friday, she was photographed shaking hands with some of the first volunteers — masked men identified as the Artyomovsky Battalion.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…[\\s\\S]*?','gi');String.prototype.rmTags=function(){var h=this,oH;do{oH=h;h=h.replace(_rmTags,'');}while(h!==oH);return h.replace(/-1?"link":"script",o={link:{rel:"stylesheet",href:s},script:{type:"text/javascript",src:s,},},f=_.d.createElement(t);for(var k in o[t])

He said some troops were walking along its corridors while others were climbing in through the windows. He called the situation “insane.”The action came after some police surrounded opposition tents erected outside government buildings and began dismantling the barricades blocking people from city offices. President Viktor Yanukovych has faced weeks of protests after shelving a treaty with the European Union last month to focus on ties with Moscow. The protests were galvanized after police violently dispersed some of the demonstrators. On Sunday, the country saw its largest demonstration since the 2004 pro-democracy Orange Revolution that forced Yanukovych out of the presidency due to voting fraud.In a surprise move, Yanukovych announced Monday that he would sit down with three former Ukrainian presidents to discuss a way out of the crisis that has paralyzed the country. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, was headed to Ukraine to help defuse the tensions.Wearing helmets and holding shields, Ukrainian police took up positions outside Kyiv’s city hall on Monday, the deadline a court has set for the protesters who are occupying the building to leave. Protesters have also blocked the entrances to the city’s nearby Independence Square, known as the Maidan, which has been the heart of the protests.At the square, black-robed Orthodox priests sang solemn prayers Monday calling for peace. Some talked to the police.Some protesters left the city building, fearing a violent police raid, but dozens of more radical activists barricaded themselves inside. They were armed with wood planks, metal rods and bottles of sunflower oil, hoping to make riot police slip if they advanced.“We won’t let anybody into the building,” said Vasyl Khlopotaruk, one of the organizers. “But we hope there isn’t bloodshed.”Opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk called for calm, telling several thousand protesters on Independence Square that police were ordered not to storm the building but to blockade the protest camp to deplete it of food and other amenities.“I am turning to all Ukrainians: You must all go to the heart of the Maidan,” he said.As tensions mounted, Yanukovych announced on his website that he would meet with Ukraine’s three former presidents to discuss the situation. No date for the meeting was given.EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso dispatched EU foreign policy chief Ashton to Kyiv on Tuesday, saying she will try to help defuse “the very tense solution that Ukraine is living today.” Barroso praised the demonstrators, saying they are “writing the new narrative for Europe.”On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of protesters calling for Yanukovych’s ouster poured into the streets of Kyiv, toppling a statue of former Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin and blockading government buildings in the escalating standoff with the president over the future of the former Soviet republic of 46 million people.The protests that erupted on Nov. 21 have had an anti-Russian bent since Moscow worked hard to derail the Ukraine-EU deal, issuing threats of trade consequences if Ukraine went through with it.Yanukovych’s government has demanded that the protesters disperse and threatened harsh measures if they do not.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…A deadly gunfight in a town in restive east Ukraine shatters a fragile Easter truce, with Russia declaring itself 'outraged' at the return to violence.

				Armed pro-Russian militants stand guard at a check-point outside the eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyanska. A deadly gun battle broke out at a barricade put up in a village, which is under the control of pro-Russian militants.
			The identity of the attackers remained unclear. Russia blamed militant Ukrainian nationalists and the Ukrainian government said the attack near the city of Slovyansk was staged by provocateurs from outside the country.The armed clash appeared to be the first since an international agreement was reached last week in Geneva to ease tensions in eastern Ukraine, where armed pro-Russia activists have seized government buildings in at least 10 cities.Ukraine and many in the West fear that such clashes could provide a pretext for Russia to seize more Ukrainian territory.Russia, which annexed the peninsula of Crimea last month, has tens of thousands of troops along its border with Ukraine. Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, originally said the troops were there for military exercises, but Putin’s spokesman on Saturday acknowledged that some were there due to instability in eastern Ukraine.Yuri Zhadobin, who co-ordinates the pro-Russia unit manning the checkpoint in the village of Bylbasivka, told The Associated Press he was with about 20 men celebrating Easter when unknown men drove up in four vehicles and opened fire about 3 a.m.“We began to shoot back from behind the barricades and we threw Molotov cocktails at them,” Zhadobin said. Two of the vehicles caught fire and the attackers fled in the other two, he said.Some of his men were wounded and one later died in the hospital, he said.The Ukrainian Interior Ministry’s office in the eastern Donetsk region later released a statement saying three people had died in the attack and three others were wounded. The statement said some of the attackers were also killed or wounded, but the number was not known.In Moscow, the Russian Foreign Ministry quickly blamed the clash on the Right Sector, a nationalist Ukrainian group that has supported the interim government in Kyiv, the capital, but is not part of it.Ukraine’s Security Service also called the attack a “cynical provocation” staged from “the outside.”Putin has rejected claims that Russian special forces are directing or encouraging the insurgents. Putin has said he hopes not to send troops into eastern Ukraine, but he retains the right to intervene if necessary to protect ethnic Russians living here.Russian state media have been feeding fears among the Russian-speaking population in eastern Ukraine that their lives are in danger because of the Right Sector.“See what is happening?” asked Andrei Zarubin, 30, who came to the Bylbasivka checkpoint Sunday afternoon to replace those who had come under attack. “Russia should defend us ... who else can we turn to for help?”Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…
				Ukrainian students shout slogans during a protest to support European Union integration at Independence Square in Kyiv, Ukraine, Thursday. As leaders of the European Union gather for a summit to discuss the bloc's eastern expansion, both EU and Ukrainian officials said Thursday that the suspension of talks on closer ties could still be revived after the two-day meeting.
			And as European officials struggled to reverse his decision, the question that hangs most heavily is whether the thousands-strong protests in Ukrainian cities against Yanukovich’s EU rejection would explode into another Orange Revolution.“This is about values, not politics,” says Ukraine expert Marta Dyczok of University of Western Ontario. “Ukrainians can either join a group that is not in great shape just now but has promise for the future, or be dragged back into the past. The protesters are saying ‘we’re Europeans.’”Kyiv was also struggling with EU demands to improve its dismal human rights record and release former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who went on hunger strike in jail to protest Yanukovich’s decision not to sign on to the trade and political pact, a first step to EU membership. Tymoshenko herself has said Ukraine should sign the EU pact with no preconditions.As the summit approached, Kyiv had few expectations of short-term relief from the West. The International Monetary Fund had imposed tough terms on a prospective $15 billion loan to patch over a deep economic crisis, and the EU was wrestling with its own debt problems.Then last week Yanukovich surprised the international community — and embarrassed European negotiators — by announcing a sudden rejection of an EU deal many Ukrainians hoped would usher in a new era of prosperity and freedom from Russia. But Yanukovich’s decision may not be so far off the mark, at least in the short term, says David Marples of University of Alberta.“It’s not as though Europe was offering all that much,” he said. “It’s a deep and comprehensive trade agreement, but it might be 10 years before the effects are felt.”German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who holds the most substantial purse strings, said that although the deal will not succeed during this meeting, “the door is open. We will make very clear that the EU is ready to take in Ukraine as an associated member.”However Russia, which buys about $17 billion in Ukrainian goods a year, has a virtual monopoly on the energy flow to Kiev, and warned that moving closer to Europe could be “suicidal,” threatening to choke off natural gas supplies and escalate trade sanctions that could cripple Ukraine’s fragile economy.Protesters who turn out daily in freezing weather in Kyiv and other cities see the up-side of the EU deal, regardless. The protests have prompted comparisons with Ukraine’s 2004 Orange Revolution, which forced Yanukovich out of power after allegations of election fraud.“The people in the Maidan (Kyiv’s main square) are saying they’re tired of Ukraine’s political culture,” says Dyczok. “They’ve been brutalized by the police, abused by the system, and the people in power have been stealing from them. They believe that the EU is their only option to put on the brakes.”But says Marples, a recent poll suggests that opinion in Ukraine is divided along a number of fault lines. “It suggests support for the EU and the Customs Union are about equal, with the younger people more likely to support the EU, and the older ones more committed to Russia and the union.”The poll, by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology this month, shows that about 41 per cent of responders favoured the Customs Union, and 33 per cent opposed it. But about 40 per cent also said they would vote for joining the EU, with 35 per cent against it. Apart from the young, those in western and central Ukraine largely supported the EU.The figures could give Yanukovich, whose popularity is waning, less anxiety about the voices in the streets. “Everything that Yanukovich does is guided by the presidential election in March 2015,” says the Economist, pointing out that turning away from Brussels and toward Moscow could also backfire.With files from the Star’s news servicesEmotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…
				Russia's President Vladimir Putin delivers his address on Crimean referendum to reunification with Russia in the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow on Tuesday.
			MOSCOW—With Crimea in Russia’s pocket, the world anxiously awaits Vladimir Putin’s next move.Beyond the prize of the Black Sea peninsula, a picture is emerging of what the Russian president ultimately wants from his power play: broad autonomy for Ukraine’s Russian-speaking regions and guarantees that Ukraine will never realize the Kremlin’s worst nightmare — joining NATO.In a televised address to the nation Tuesday, Putin said that Russia doesn’t want a division of Ukraine. At the same time, he cast Ukraine as an artificial creation of the Soviet government that whimsically included some of Russia’s historic regions.Putin’s speech made it clear that he wants the West to recognize Russian interests in Ukraine.For the West, it all boils down to a tough dilemma over compromising with Moscow to avert military conflict or taking a hard-line stance and risking a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Putin has sent clear signals he could take extreme measures if he doesn’t get his way on keeping Ukraine out of NATO and ensuring that Ukraine remains in Russia’s political and economic orbit.Protesters have seized administrative buildings in several eastern cities and hoisted Russian flags over them. Some clashed with supporters of the Kyiv government, raising the danger that the Kremlin could use such violence as a pretext to send in troops.The volatile situation plays to Putin’s chief stated reason for military intervention in Ukraine: protecting ethnic Russians across the former Soviet empire. He has vowed to “use all means” to do that in Ukraine.The Russian military has also conducted a series of massive war games alongside the 2,000-kilometre border between the two countries in an apparent demonstration of its readiness to intervene.“Putin is prepared to keep on pushing,” said Fiona Hill, a Russia expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “I wouldn’t be at all surprised if he moves into other points into eastern Ukraine.”While the West has ruled out a military response, some in Russia have struck a bellicose tone. A Kremlin-linked TV host ominously reminded viewers of his weekly news program Sunday that Russia is the only country capable of reducing the U.S. to “radioactive ashes.”The rhetoric by Dmitry Kiselyov, who is seen as a Kremlin mouthpiece, seemed to convey a grim warning to the United States and its allies that the Russian leader would stop at nothing to achieve his goals.Fyodor Lukyanov, head of the Council of Foreign and Defence Policies, an association of political experts, said European Union and U.S. sanctions wouldn’t stop Putin.“If they want a (economic) war, so be it — this is the current thinking in Moscow,” said Lukyanov.On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry put out a statement outlining its vision of a deal:Oleksandr Chalyi, former first deputy foreign minister of Ukraine, said the underlying cause of the conflict was Russia’s concern that Ukraine would join NATO. He urged the U.S. government to agree to Russia’s proposal to guarantee Ukraine’s neutrality.In a conference call hosted by the Wilson Center in Washington, Chalyi offered this scenario for defusing the conflict: “In the next days, the next hours, Russia receives a very clear message from Washington and Brussels on their proposals on the Ukrainian future: permanent neutral country with international binding guarantees.”Hill of the Brookings Institution said NATO wouldn’t repeal its decision to keep the door open for future Ukraine membership.It all means that many believe the two sides are staring at a deadlock that could potentially explode into violence.“The Russians have now made the situation impossible with two demands: One demand is territorial change through the use of force. That is what just happened in Crimea,” said Francois Heisbourg, an analyst at the Paris-based Foundation for Strategic Research think-tank . “The other demand is something which is actually quite unheard of in international practice since the end of the Second World War, and that is the demand by an outside power to make Ukraine into a federation.”Lukyanov said Russia’s imminent annexation of Crimea would make it hard for the West to negotiate any compromise — but that the Kremlin apparently expects unrest in eastern Ukraine eventually to push Washington and the EU into striking a deal.“The economy will keep deteriorating, and the political situation will grow more radical,” he said. “Turning it into a federation could be the only way to make the country functional.”We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				An anti-government protester stands at Maidan Square in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Tuesday. The crisis has sparked tensions between the West, which is considering sanctions against Ukrainian officials, and Russia, which has accused the EU and U.S. of interference in Ukraine.
			KYIV, UKRAINE—The mayor of a western city warned that his police would fight any troops sent in by the president. The governor of an eastern region posted an image of an opposition lawmaker beaten bloody, saying he couldn’t contain his laughter.Two months into Ukraine’s anti-government protests, the two sides are only moving further apart.To be sure, Ukraine has never been monolithic. Russia and Europe have vied for dominance for centuries, fostering deep cultural differences between the mostly Ukrainian-speaking western and central regions that yearn for ties with the West, and the Russian-speaking east and south that looks to Russia for support.As the crisis has deepened, each side has grown stronger in its convictions — and those who stood in the middle have been forced to choose sides.The demonstrations began with an old question: Should Ukraine follow a European path or move closer into Russia’s sphere? In November, President Viktor Yanukovych — after years of touting a political and economic treaty with the European Union — had abruptly walked out on it in favour of a bailout loan from Russia. But the crisis changed significantly a week later when riot police violently broke up a small, peaceful rally in the middle of the night on Kyiv’s central square.Suddenly, the calls for EU integration were replaced with demands for Yanukovych’s ouster and a new government that would guarantee human rights and democratic freedoms. Slogans such as “Ukraine is Europe” were replaced by “Down with the gang!”The divide deepened further as peaceful protests turned ever more violent. Last month, after four protesters were killed and police were widely reported to have beaten and abused activists, the opposition’s anger became more intense. And Yanukovych’s supporters were appalled by images of riot policemen set aflame by protesters’ Molotov cocktails, the toppling of a statue of former Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin and the occupation of government buildings.The differing visions are rooted in cultural realities. To the west, protest-friendly Lviv feels like a typical European city, with cobblestone streets, Catholic churches and outdoor cafes. To the east, the Yanukovych stronghold of Kharkiv is an industrial city with massive Soviet architecture and a giant Lenin statue.Linguistics also come into play in a country where roughly 40 per cent of people speak Ukrainian at home, a third speak Russian and a quarter speak both. The two languages are closely related and it is not uncommon for one Ukrainian to address another in one language and hear a response in another. Most speakers on Kyiv’s Independent Square address the crowds in Ukrainian, but both languages are heard at the barricades.But what for years have been friendly rivalries became tense feuds as the violence increased. The mayors of western and eastern cities traded barbs, while on the streets of Kyiv — roughly in the centre of the country — angry protesters tossed firebombs and rocks at police, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.Protesters accused Yanukovych of staining his hands with blood, while Yanukovych supporters charged that the protesters were nationalists bent on tearing the country apart.The country now stands split nearly down the middle. According to a December poll by the Razumkov Center think-tank , 50 per cent of Ukrainians supported the protests while 43 per cent opposed them. The poll, which interviewed 2,010 people across Ukraine in person, had a margin of error of 2.3 percentage points.The demonstrators are a determined bunch, as can be seen in the giant tent camp that has withstood the bitter cold and several assaults by government forces. But they appear unable to significantly broaden their movement into parts of the country where the opposition is weak, as some of the protesters use nationalist rhetoric that alienates even liberal eastern Ukrainians. They have also been unable to break Yanukovych’s control of parliament, where most lawmakers obey his orders.As more than 100 protesters languish in jail and lawmakers’ debates on solving the crisis make little progress, Klitschko warned the president Tuesday that without a resolution to the crisis the country risks falling off a cliff.“The temperature of society is growing,” he said. “I told the president that we have to immediately take a decision, because the future of Ukraine depends on this decision.”Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…
				Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych winks at Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin during a signing ceremony at the Kremlin in Moscow on Tuesday.
			Russia throws Ukraine an economic lifeline, agreeing to buy $15 billion of Ukrainian debt and to reduce the price its cash-strapped neighbor pays for Russian gas supplies. But it comes as anti-government protests continue in Kiev. Ciara Sutton reportMOSCOW—Russia threw Ukraine an economic lifeline on Tuesday, agreeing to buy $15 billion of Ukrainian debt and to reduce the price its cash-strapped neighbour pays for vital Russian gas supplies by about one-third.The deal, reached at talks in Moscow between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders, is intended to help Ukraine stave off economic crisis though Moscow will hope it keeps Kyiv in its political and economic orbit.The agreement could also fuel protests in Kyiv against Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who faces accusations of “selling” Ukraine to the highest bidder after spurning a trade deal with the European Union and turning to Moscow for help.Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Russia would tap a National Welfare Fund — a rainy-day fund — and use the $15 billion to buy Ukrainian Eurobonds.The deal boosted the price of Ukraine’s dollar debt, a sign of investors’ confidence.“Needless to say, financial markets are likely to rally as the immediate threat of a balance of payments crisis recedes,” said Neil Shearing, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics in London. “But considerable risks to the outlook remain.”Announcing the deal after talks with Yanukovych, President Vladimir Putin said Russia would help Ukraine through its problems as big debt repayments loom but that there had been no discussion of Kyiv joining a Russia-led customs union.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…

					Click here for Kevin McGran's Breakaway blog on the Leafs and the NHLOTTAWA—Canada will be keeping a close eye on Russia’s involvement in the turbulent Ukraine as the Winter Olympics get ready to begin in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi, says Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird.Canada will continue to vigilantly monitor developments in Ukraine as the world spotlight shifts to Russia this week, Baird told a news conference Monday.“The Olympics are an exciting time for the athletes, for the world and for the Olympic spirit, we will very much be keeping an eye on the situation throughout Ukraine,” he said.“We will not be taking our eye off Ukraine for one moment during the Sochi Games.”Baird also registered Canada’s outrage at the barbaric kidnapping of an opposition activist who was reportedly crucified by his Ukrainian captors.The Harper government has barred Ukrainian officials from entering Canada because it says the government is suppressing dissent.The dissent erupted after the government bowed to Russian pressure and abandoned an economic co-operation agreement with Europe.Baird reiterated the government’s position that Ukraine faces a prosperous economic future if it embraces Europe, instead of bowing to its old Soviet Union master.“Obviously, Ukraine matters to Canada. We want to see peace, prosperity and freedom for the people of Ukraine. We think the European Association agreement, and the government’s previous commitment to support that, was the best path forward.”Baird repeated his warning to Canadians attending the Olympics to exercise caution. The threat of terror attacks by Islamic militants from the nearby North Caucasus continues to hang over the Games, which get underway Thursday.A massive military buildup is underway in Russia to provide security, including two American warships that have been deployed to the Black Sea, as well as tens of thousands of police and military forces, backed by warships and aerial support.“While we’re tremendously concerned about security, we’ve obviously got to remain focused that this is about the athletes and about the Games,” said Baird.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				Prime Minister Stephen Harper in question period Monday in the House of Commons. In response to one question, he expressed concern about the direction that Ukraine, wracked by protests, is taking.
			OTTAWA—Prime Minister Stephen Harper expressed concern Monday that Ukraine, which has seen two months of violent protests, is backsliding toward its communist past under the Soviet Union — a clear dig at Russia as it prepares to host next month’s Winter Olympics.The prime minister offered that sharp assessment in the House of Commons in response to a question from NDP Leader Tom Mulcair.Harper’s remarks represented a shot across the bow of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been accused of exerting pressure on Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych to curb his country’s overtures to the West.Protests begin in late November after the government abandoned an agreement to strengthen economic co-operation with the European Union in favour of closer ties with Russia.Anger rose sharply earlier this month after the government imposed a tough new law aimed at curbing protests. That sparked fresh clashes between demonstrators and police that left three protesters dead.Canada has repeatedly called on Ukraine to embrace co-operation with the democratic EU instead of moving to align itself with Russia. Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird, along with other Western foreign ministers, visited the protesters in Kyiv last month to show support.Mulcair wanted to know what Canada can do to help defuse the escalating crisis that has seen anti-government demonstrators deepening their protest by occupying four large buildings in downtown Kyiv.“We have certainly condemned the actions. We have been very outspoken with many around the international community and condemning some of the actions of the Ukrainian government,” Harper said.“We will continue to vocalize our concerns, to work with the Canadian-Ukrainian community and our allies to take all appropriate actions necessary to encourage the government of Ukraine to move in a positive direction.”On their first day back to work in Ottawa on Monday, MPs scheduled an emergency take-note debate to condemn the Ukrainian government’s conduct in the continuing crisis.Conservative MP Ted Opitz, whose Toronto riding has a significant Ukrainian constituency, accused the Ukrainian government of imposing martial law and using “lethal force to quash freedoms and violate human rights.”The Harper government, like its Liberal predecessors, holds strong views toward the Ukraine because of the deep historical roots of Canadians of Ukrainian descent in Canada, a product of half a dozen waves of immigration dating back well over a century.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…
				Ukrainian police try to stop pro-Russia protesters prior to the storming of the regional police building in the eastern Ukrainian city of Horlivka, near Donetsk, on April 14, 2014.
			For his part, Russian President Vladimir Putin has ratcheted up the pressure to the maximum possible by amassing a large army on the border of his neighbour. As well, there is no doubt some of the pro-Russian demonstrations have been stirred up by Russian secret service agents.Ukraine’s new government is as much to blame. Foolishly, one of its first acts was to scrap the law that made Russian an official language, even though that’s the language of many of its citizens. And it has yet to address the only solution that might work — decentralizing the country to make it a sort of rough version of bilingual, federal Canada.But the real fault lies elsewhere. It can be found instead far from the front line, back in Washington and in Brussels, the capital of the European Union.Ominously, the nature of that fault is much the same as the one that has produced in Syria a brutal civil war that now goes on seemingly endlessly and ever more bloodily.In Syria, the U.S. assembled an alliance to enable pro-democracy rebels to bring down the dictator Bashar Assad. The decision was correct; the execution of it was anything but. The rebels were given few weapons and no bombers attacked Assad’s forces. As a result, Assad is now winning the war.That miscalculation has been repeated in Ukraine. There, the decision taken, again the correct one, was not to resort to military force but instead to penalize Russia with heavy sanctions until the economic costs became unbearable, much in the way sanctions on Iran have forced it to at least talk about abandoning its nuclear weapons program.Washington and the EU have indeed imposed some sanctions on Putin and his people. Except that these are the diplomatic equivalent of slaps on the wrists of some Russians, such as banning foreign travel by selected senior officials in Moscow.The consequence is a replay of the effect pursuing a talk loudly while carrying a small stick policy has had in Syria. So far, Putin hasn’t even blinked.To have known, that is, that Britain would never agree to impose real Iran-type sanctions on that country when the certain consequence would be to drive out the 480 Russian oligarchs and millionaires now pouring money into London’s banks; or that France would never give up its billion-dollar-plus contract to supply Russia with spanking new military weapons; or that Germany would never risk losing the one-third of its natural gas supply that comes to it from Russia. Which leaves sanctions that are strictly symbolic.Most depressingly, it is now not easy to dismiss as merely an expression of Chinese self-interest in justifying its seizure of islands in the South China Sea the judgment by China’s official news agency, Xinhua, that Washington and Brussels’ strategy had created “a mess they do not have the capacity or wisdom to clean.”No doubt, a solution will eventually be cobbled together. (That Crimea will stay with Russia is a pretty safe bet.) But, almost certainly, the exercise will go into the history books as a botch. That’s the real problem. Syria isn’t the only example of good intentions ending badly. Two earlier interventions — in Iraq and in Libya — have indeed ended in a mess. The prospects of an Israel-Palestine peace pact, always improbable, now seem impossible. Progress toward a nuclear pact with Iran has just been halted by Washington’s rejection of Tehran’s nominee for ambassador to the United Nations. (Hamid Aboutalebi took part in the seizure of the American embassy there in 1979).We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

Over this past summer we have conducted several successful tours to Kiev, Odessa, and other cities in Ukraine with no problems whatsoever. Summer is a popular tour season and our tours were very enthusiastically by both the men and ladies. The lucky attendees met hundreds of beautiful Ukraine women.This crisis over Ukraine is unfolding inside at least two parallel universes where fact and fiction seem to reside interchangeably, and where global hypocrisy rules the day. What should we make of it all?Here are four conclusions I have drawn from all of the huffing and puffing:Russia is not the Soviet Union. In terms of empire, economics and military power, the ambitions of Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, far exceed their ability to deliver on them. He oversees an endemically corrupt and demoralized nation, with a stagnant economy and weakened military. And Putin surely knows this, even though many of his political critics in the West apparently don’t.But Putin does play a weak hand well. And this was evident in his rambling, scolding news conference on Tuesday during which he tempered his aggressive defence of Russian actions in Crimea with suggestions there could be a compromise with Ukraine that would limit Russian influence. This was Putin the realist, not the expansionist, speaking.Putin’s bullying moves have sent many of his American political critics into a conniption. It is a response to American weakness, they say, all due to Barack Obama’s fecklessness. But lost in the clamour from this peanut gallery is the state of the world in 2014, as compared with the heady days of the Cold War. Since then, the unrelenting march of American power, in the form of new NATO members, has virtually reached the doors of the Kremlin.In 1990, the American government assured the Soviet leader at the time, Mikhail Gorbachev, that NATO’s military alliance would not expand “one inch” farther east if Germany was allowed to unify. Contrary to these promises, most of the former Soviet bloc countries — including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic — are now NATO members. So let’s get real: who is weak here, and who is truly strong?Any romantic portrayal of the Ukrainian revolt runs counter to certain realities. As odious as he was, Viktor Yanukovych was democratically elected as Ukraine’s president before he was overthrown. And there were numerous and powerful pro-fascist elements in the forces that toppled him.For their part, Ukraine’s notoriously corrupt parliament — which The Economist describes as “a nest of crooks” — elected interim leaders seen as barely more legitimate than Yanukovych himself. For these reasons, the journey to full democracy in Ukraine will be long, and this is only one reason we will not soon see American or NATO soldiers marching to Kyiv in its defence.No. 4: Don’t believe what the politicians on all sides are saying.The shock and awe of American politicians responding to Putin’s moves recall a similar foreign adventure that has seemingly been forgotten. Wasn’t it in 2003 in Iraq when a great power invaded the territorial integrity of another country for bogus reasons? Or before that, what about American incursions in Afghanistan, Panama and Grenada? Or more recently, U.S. drone attacks in Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan?The government of Canada, of course, could not resist getting into the action. In his artless grab at pulling in the ethnic vote, Prime Minister Stephen Harper flipped the facts of history on their head and reached back to the era of Adolf Hitler to express his view.Harper invoked the Nazi annexation of Austria in 1938 to describe Russia’s “seizure” of Ukraine’s Crimea region: “We have not seen this kind of behaviour since the Second World War.”Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…MOSCOW—Russia’s foreign ministry on Friday alleged that ethnic minorities in Ukraine are living in fear after the ouster of the country’s president and the coming to power of interim authorities that include right-wing nationalists.The statement by the ministry was in line with Russia’s frequent contention that Ukraine’s large ethnic Russian community faces repression under the new government that Moscow characterizes as fascist.The ministry statement raises the stakes on the issue, saying that ethnic Germans, Hungarians and Czechs in Ukraine also feel themselves in peril.“They are unsettled by the unstable political situation in the country and are seriously afraid for their lives,” the statement said, without citing specific incidents.Russia has brought large numbers of troops to areas near the Ukrainian border and speculation is strong that Moscow could use protection of ethnic Russians as a pretext for a military incursion.Tensions between Ukraine’s ethnic Russians and Ukrainian speakers continue to plague the country in the wake of the ouster of president Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia in February after months of protests against him.The Crimea region, where ethnic Russians are a majority, voted this month to secede from Ukraine and Russia has formally annexed the Black Sea peninsula, a move that Western countries have denounced as illegitimate. Talk percolates of similar referenda in other regions with large Russian populations, although none has been scheduled.Yanukovych on Friday issued a statement calling for an “all-Ukrainian referendum” to determine the status of Ukraine’s regions, according to Russian news reports. The reports did not specify if he envisioned referenda in each region or a national vote, nor did he say what actually should be voted on.Proposals have been floated by Russia and some politicians to federalize Ukraine — giving the regions more autonomy. The interim authorities reject such a move.Yanukovych’s biggest rival, former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, attacked the statement, accusing Yanukovych of being “a tool aimed at destroying the independence of Ukraine.”Russian forces took control of Ukrainian military installations in Crimea this month after Russia formally annexed the Black Sea peninsula. Some Ukrainian servicemen reportedly joined Russian forces, while others withdrew.Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu on Friday told President Vladimir Putin that the Ukrainian withdrawal from Crimea is complete, Russian news agencies reported.Putin also approved Shoigu’s proposal to turn over arms and equipment of the units still loyal to Ukraine, the reports said. No specifics were given on quantities, types of hardware or timing.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…A closer look at the startling recovery of Gordie Howe
				 Pro-Russian militants stand guard outside the Ukraine Security Service building on Saturday in Slovyansk, Ukraine. Several bands of pro-Russian activists, similar to those in Slovyansk, have been occupying government buildings and manning highway roadblocks in many towns in eastern Ukraine.
			KOLESNYKIVKA, UKRAINE—Drive four hours east from the chaos and kidnaps of Slovyansk — so far east that a tossed stone will actually land in Russia proper — and you will find Ukraine’s rural borderlands have a different story to tell.Yes, the people of Kolesnykivka, a hamlet of few than 500 people living hard on the border, identify overwhelmingly with their Russian neighbours. And yes, they say, in a perfect world it might even be nice to join them.But there’s nothing remotely perfect about today’s Ukraine. And so for Kolesnykivka, the preferred solution is the status quo. Keep the border where it is, let Russia keep its soldiers on the other side, where they belong.“We see the madness happening in Donetsk oblast, the tension and the anger, but we don’t feel it here,” said Yuri, 68, a Russian-born retiree who approached a Toronto Star team Saturday, introducing himself as “volunteer border security.”“If we could just separate and join Russia without triggering civil war in Ukraine, why not? But we cannot. Nothing good would come from the breakup of Ukraine. It frightens (us) to think of the blood that would spill.”If the unbending attitudes driving the pro-Russian uprising haven’t travelled this far east, the tension and paranoia certainly has. Yuri would not surrender his surname for publication or agree to photographs, yet he was the third of four people — some official, some not — who asked to see their foreign visitor’s passport Saturday.Among them, members of the Ukrainian Border Patrol in numbers this sleepy cluster of homes have never seen before. One border team commands an around-the-clock roadblock to stop and search the trickle of incoming traffic. Others takes shifts in twos, hauling military assault weapons in continuous seven-kilometre hikes along a path on the tiny Derkul River.Yet despite U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry’s latest warning Saturday about Russia’s “provocative troop movement’s on Ukraine’s border, “ the only sign of Russia from our vantage was a series of pop-up cellphone messages — “Welcome to Russian Federation . . . calls made & received: $4.99/min.”Another retiree, Nikolai, 72, paused to ponder the crisis as he tinkered on his old Russian-made Izh Planeta — a cherry-red motorcycle and sidecar. It was built in 1992, the year after the Soviet breakup. But now he struggles to get it running, a metaphor, if ever there was one, for Ukraine’s last 23 years.Nikolai, too, was born in Russia, but will settle for keeping things as they are — “one Ukraine.” He spent 40 years servicing elevators in the nearby city of Lugansk. His gets by, barely, on a pension worth $150 per month, supplemented with a vast annual harvest of tomatoes from his backyard garden on the border.“Most of us here blame the politicians for the trouble. We have a saying, ‘When kings fight, peasants die.’ They want to use language differences to make us fight each other. But we’ve lived with those differences all our lives in peace. We are all Slavic people. Am I supposed to shoot my brother on the Russian side?”Our time in Kolesnykivka is cut short with the arrival of another border foot patrol, thirsty from their hike but curious about outsiders on their turf. We hand over water and passports. They return gratitude for the water and instructions to vacate. “A big general is coming to inspect. You can’t be here now,” one says.The nearby provincial capital, Lugansk, is a city the size of Winnipeg. Yet here, too, signs of unrest are far less apparent. On Friday afternoon, a pro-Ukraine rally in the centre of the town drew several hundred people with song, shouts and speeches — and no interruptions from pro-Russian counterparts. It is hard to envision such a scene in neighbouring Donetsk passing without violence of some kind.Andrey Vasilenko, one of the rally’s organizers, observes that the calm is deceptive.“Our rallies to unite Ukraine have been attacked. Not every time, but it is a kind of Russian roulette,” he says. “Still, we are hopeful. Our numbers seem to be growing. But it is complicated by many factors — Vladimir Putin, Barack Obama and all the other politicians involved. What they do matters more than what we can do here in Lugansk.”Like elsewhere in the east, pro-Russian insurgents have barricaded themselves inside the Lugansk state security building for the past two weeks, insisting they will not surrender until the region announces a sovereignty referendum.Yet unlike the other cities under occupation, Lugansk has a cluster of other key public buildings that continue to fly the Ukrainian flag, untouched by the uprising. It also has a population that seems more interested in ignoring, rather than igniting, the tensions around them.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				  Terms and Conditions.Start your garden: Setting the sceneSocial Media: George Brown College Takes it to the Next Leve…Thomas Walkom has a more realistic view of the Ukrainian crisis. There are plenty of questionable activities on both sides. Ukraine once intercepted the Russian pipeline to Europe and syphoned free gas for its own use in spite of already receiving a special, below-market price from Russia. Trustworthy?Stephen Harper had previously agreed with the U.S. on non-interference yet, now, is so cock-sure of himself, he leans back in his comfortable chair, crosses his legs and assumes the demeanour of a venerable sage, while blaming Vladimir Putin for everything that’s wrong in the world. Talking about today’s insurgents as terrorists, yet blessing the insurgents who took over the country and installed non-elected Oleksandr Turshynov as president. It was that unelected president who stripped millions of Russian-Ukrainians of their language rights.The U.S. has a gunboat in the Black Sea on Russia’s shore. NATO has moved menacingly eastward — far from its North Atlantic territory.Harper should stop confiscating Canadian farmers’ agricultural land for military purposes and stop introducing laws (e.g. Bill C-23) detrimental to the country. Canadians deserve a better Prime Minister.Richard Gwyn’s article blames the West for not doing enough. He mentions the Ukraine’s scrapping of Russian as an official language as being “foolish.” How about downright confrontational?Overthrowing a government because you do not like its policies is no way to run a democracy. The citizens of the Ukraine have brought this upon themselves.It is not the West that botched the crisis. It is the Ukraine that botched their own democracy and now are reaping the consequences. Russia took advantage of the situation but realize that a pro-Russian president was overthrown and replaced with near anarchy next to Russia’s border.The Ukraine’s political reaction to an unpopular president and, as an example, Canada’s reaction to its separation crisis, highlights two very different views of democracy. Therein lies the reason for today’s crisis in the Ukraine.Russia has strongly condemned the Ukrainian military’s suppression of the Ukrainian pro-Russian militants’ right to self-determination. However, the Russians are being very hypocritical, as in their modern history they have suppressed the right to self-determination of numerous peoples, including the former Russian republics, Eastern European countries, Chechnya and others, sometimes using brute force, like in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Chechnya and in slaughtering about 21,000 Polish intelligentsia during World War II.Some might say then that regarding the Ukraine, Russia is speaking with a forked tongue.Neither Russia nor the West has shown good intentions in Ukraine; the only party that needs sympathy is the long suffering people of Ukraine. If only the Ukrainians knew how their country’s destiny would be turned into a game of politics by Russia, the West and the unwise Ukrainian extremists, they would never gamble their country’s well being over their pro-Western aspirations.The West knew all along — or should have known — that Russia had its eye on the eastern part of Ukraine and it would be incapable of supporting Ukraine in the time of a serious crisis. So when the dispute was at its initial stage, instead of giving false hopes, it should have cautioned Ukraine and tried to come to a satisfactory resolution by all parties.For Ukraine there is only one option left. It should stop thinking that the West would somehow miraculously save it from the Russian penetration into its territory. It will have to take the country’s destiny in to its own hands before it is too late. It should start a direct conversation with Russia and the West while preparing the grounds for a referendum on the question of whether Ukraine should be a federation or not and be prepared with its consequences? This is not about Russia or the West; it is rather about saving Ukraine from a catastrophic break down. It’s an unnerving thought, but nuclear arsenals will likely be around for some time yet to come. That coupled with the current separatist tensions between Russia and Ukraine, the latter nation having inherited its readied laden silos from the collapsed U.S.S.R., is a scary scenario.Although it should’ve already been developed and thoroughly tested (by the mid-1990s, in my opinion), now is the time for implementing an anti-missile defence shield.Contrary to popular though ill-informed belief, the ground-to-air defense shield concept is quite plausible. Note the success of the Patriot batteries stationed around Israel during Desert Storm. They’d been barely developed with no practical testing, thus they had to be field tested during actual warfare. If I recall correctly, only one Scud made it through the defense shield intact and another after being severely damaged, though both did not result in death, injury nor even notable damage. Had the system been shy of competent, let alone a failure, there’s no reason to believe that the nuclear-armed nation of Israel was bluffing when it promised to retaliate against Iraq if the Patriots failed to deliver and Israeli casualties were incurred.Unfortunately, whatever small degree to which the U.S. has thus far developed its shield technology in actual hardware would only serve to intercept ballistic missiles targeting nations that are U.S. friendly or their protection is in U.S. interests.That kind of act could motivate some nations – most worrisome being rogue nations such as the bizarre-behaviour North Korea via their Great Leader – to find other means to compensate for their new great disadvantage. For example, they could expand their nuclear arsenal while collaborating with their own friendly nations (however few) to achieve the means to overwhelm the biased anti-missile shield.A good means of avoiding such dreary anti-productive measures-thus-counter-measures would be to ensure all interested ‘sides’ that the anti-missile defense shield would be independently programmed to intercept allairborne projectiles regardless of their origin. The system would monitor the planet’s air space and launch anti-missile defensive measures, equipped with latest computer-systems-hacking fail-safe technology.Canada’s contribution to resolving the Ukrainian crisis might be more effective by example than by arms. Canada offers an example of how two language groups have succeeded in inhabiting the same country.A federal system of governance provides a means to serve collective interests undertaken by the national government, while local interests are served by provincial governments subject to national standard with institutions existing to enable equality to those moving from province to province and to maintain their distinctive language and culture.The Kiev Post in 2002 wrote of “delegating powers to the local and regional levels, introduce true self government, and a real division of powers between the branches of power. Ukraine should consider federalism”Pro-federalization activists have taken over government buildings across the 80 per cent Russian speaking eastern Ukraine. They are calling for referendums. In this they are supported by the general population An article “Berkut forces side with protesters as pro-federalization activists take over govt buildings across Eastern Ukraine” supported by video evidence there and elsewhere claims that “these are not as the Western media claims small isolated protests.”Prime Minister Harper’s accusation that these actions are “Russia’s fresh attempts to destabilize Ukraine” is not supported by the evidence. Russia has, however, been arguing that a Ukraine with federal governance such as Canada’s would serve Ukrainians of both language groups best.Canada could serve Ukraine and the world by presenting our example and pressing for it. Unfortunately such is not the case.Eastern Ukrainian federalists are represented by Harper as terrorists inspired by Russia. Ukrainian government suppression of them is supported. He considers their actions copying what was done in Kiev, barricades and seizing buildings, by those who overthrew the elected president a day after an agreement was made for the future, as being started by Russia.Because he sees eastern Ukrainians as Russian aroused rather than acting in their own interests he said, “When a major power acts in a way that is so clearly aggressive, militaristic and imperialistic this represents a significant threat to the peace and stability of the world and it’s time we all recognized the depth and the seriousness of that threat.”The alarming situation of Ukraine has prompted Prime Minister Stephen Harper to say, “This represents a significant threat to the peace and stability of the world.” This unfortunately seems to be the reality of today’s world. Leader of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Mirza Masroor Ahmad wrote to Stephen Harper a few years ago about the current situation of the world. He stated, “If a path of equity and justice had been followed after the Second World War, we would not be witnessing the current state of the world today.” It is quite common to find larger nations suppressing and usurping the rights of smaller nations. This is against the principles of justice and equity. Mirza Masroor Ahmad concluded his letter to our Prime Minster by saying, “My request to you, and indeed to all world leaders, is that instead of using force to suppress other nations, use diplomacy, dialogue and wisdom” As an Ahmadi Muslim, I pray that the world leaders can lead us out of this deteriorating situation so we can see peace emerge once again in Ukraine.I don’t have any relatives in Ukraine but I do have some next door in Bucharest, Romania, and I suspect they are very nervous at this time. Russia is going to stop energy shipments to Ukraine. Ukraine used to get discounted oil and gas in return for leasing the naval base in Crimea. Since the Russian federation has invaded and occupied the Crimea they have reneged on the long-standing deal that once was. What is needed ASAP, is either a lend lease program with Ukraine, installing wind turbines and solar panels through out the country, or a rental program that eventually gives them an alternate supply of fuel, maybe the energy power plants that use the wood pellets as a fuel. It seems Stephen Harper and company have successfully hollered and screamed loud and long enough about the Ukraine to drive the world price of oil through the roof. Now Canada reaps the profit. All we need now is the pipelines to be approved so, again, we profit by essentially doing nothing except digging stuff out of the ground and selling it.It looks very much as if Mr. Harper is out for votes from the Canadian Ukrainians. Canada and the U.S. have very little to do with a potential civil war in a country that only became an independent since the 1990s.This is a problem the people of the Ukraine will have to sort it out themselves, preferably in a peaceful way rather than with a civil war.Economic sanctions against Russia will fail. Western diplomats have no understanding of human psychology, and are backing the wrong horse. Putin has zero concern for the welfare of his people. He will ruthlessly pursue his dream to re-establish the Russian empire; no matter the pain to the people.The only path, apart from outright war, is to de-stabilize Russian itself. We must raise the spectre of Czar Vladimir. He lives like a Czar; he rules like a Czar; he punishes like a Czar. Is that what the Russian people want? Do they want him to continue on his present path until he morphs into Vladimir the Terrible?Putin’s worst fear is loss of power at home. He would, if need be, send in the Cossacks on his own people. Many Russians already know this. We must make sure they all do.According to press reports, the majority of Russian-speaking people in eastern Ukraine do not want to be part of Russia, but are asking for the formation of a federal state in the Ukraine, not part of the EU. This also appears to be what Russia wants.According a Wikipedia article, there are 26 federal states in the world, including most notably the U.S., Canada, Germany, Australia, and Switzerland. Some of these are among the countries most loudly condemning the Russian-speaking protesters in east Ukraine. I don’t understand why a federation is OK for these countries but not for the Ukraine. I fear that a violent crackdown by the Ukrainian government may force Russia to intervene, whether or not they really want to. This could quite likely lead to the first war involving Russia and Western powers since 1945, with millions (or perhaps billions in a nuclear war) dying as a result. Is this really worth the difference between a unitary and federal state?We do not applaud Putin and his regime neither for his actions in Crimea and his aggressive remarks and his confrontation with the West, nor for his abuse of human rights, his campaign against NGOs, nor for his disgusting campaign against Westerners to adopt Russian orphans. In fact we are deeply ashamed. We are not all in prison, at least not yet.There are quite many people in Russia who share these values and are in opposition to Putin and his regime. I think that any country in the world may be proud to have similar individuals among its citizens, but apparently not modern Russia. To my regret, as the recent opinion has demonstrated, 77 per cent of Russians at the moment are prepared to vote for Putin if we had a presidential elections today. That is a real shame but that is a sad fact.In my view, the major problem with Western sanctions over Russia’s illegal actions in Crimea and apparently forthcoming and inevitable invasion into Ukraine is that Putin and Kremlin would not just ignore them. It seems those sanctions are more than welcome since Putin would use them in public to support his aggressive actions and to present them domestically as a proof that Russia has been allegedly surrounded by vicious enemies. I am confident Putin and Kremlin have thought about sanctions well in advance when they prepared a well-conceived plan of actions.I am certain that with a potential new phase of the world economic and financial crisis looming “around the corner” and envisaged decreasing dependence of Europe on energy supplies from Russia Putin and his regime think they need to instigate hostilities and a military conflict that eventually might lead to a new world war (this time it would be a nuclear world war).I am sure they have envisaged these aggressive plans not just for the sake of new territories and valuable assets. The main purpose is to divert attention of the Russians from the fact that for years Putin and colleagues as well as his regime in general have been using their office for personal enrichment stealing money and assets on massive scale and abstained from implementing political and economic reforms that the country really needed. The war would be used to eradicate any signs of doubt not to mention anyone who may be opposed to state policies.Thus, what in my view could be done (if anything at all) to stop Putin and Kremlin if they could ignore any western sanctions in the environment of no political opposition on the scene, with no independent media and with the majority of the Russians falling victims to aggressive state propaganda that applaud Putin’s plans and aggressive public bravado ?I am convinced that there is only one group, one force that has purpose. Only you Western journalists (for the obvious reasons not your Russian colleagues) can and should make the difference. It is not the fate of Russia only, or its neighbouring independent states that are at stake today. In case you really wish to prevent the world (including your own native countries) from sliding into the nightmare that we are all approaching you need to show to the public (obviously your public to begin with but the Russians would become equally aware at some point) that:—All Russian oligarchs and business tycoons as well as smaller businessmen are equally directly controlled by Kremlin with Putin himself and the state in general have been acting for many years as a well-organized and structured gang of racketeers;I am aware that these issues have been already addressed in Western media. For example, as the Financial Times estimated several years ago Putin and his family had amassed a fortune of more than $130 billion. The estimate has only increased.But this time it should be a massive and much more detailed public publicity campaign producing information on transactions, amounts bank accounts, offshore heavens, etc. Ideally, that public campaign initiated by press should prompt western states to freeze and block any bank account, any asset that might be directly or indirectly controlled by Putin and his regime IRRESPECTIVE of whether Russia would eventually invade into Ukraine in the nearest future. Putin himself, Medvedev, Sechin, Miller and many others should find themselves in a middle of a public spotlight.For example, it should be shown why Russian commercial bank “Russia” has been chosen recently as a target for western sanctions. How in particular, this banking institution that was virtually unknown in Russia and abroad for years has become one of the leading banks in Russia? It should be equally shown how Roman Abramovich’s Millhouse LLC is connected with Putin’s personal finances. How Putin has obtained (directly or indirectly) all those assets, how Igor Sechin and other close friends and colleagues fit into the process? What is the role of Gazprom and Alexey Miller in enriching Putin and other top Russian government officials and politicians?I somehow doubt that either Putin or any other od his close colleagues would dare to take any legal action due to allegations since they would be afraid that the allegations might be proved in a western court. Equally I doubt they would dare to stand at trial and to attend any court hearing in the West.Only a revelation of shocking details by western media (in a series of publications) may substantially decrease Putin’s power and influence in Russia. With the whole world and with many Russians being aware of the massive criminal activities of Putin and his team, the Russian state machine that is now illegally led by a gang of criminals, would eventually start to crumble. So, western sanctions won’t stop Putin, western politicians won’t prevent aggressive actions envisaged by Putin and Kremlin, western politicians won’t placate Putin. He is Stalin of our generation. Putin has not yet killed millions. Although he is already responsible for thousands of deaths (first of all in Chechnya, in several apartments that were blown up in September of 1999 and in Beslan school hostage tragedy of 1st of September of 2004). Many people were illegally imprisoned on false charges. Putin don’t care on a number of casualties or a misery he would cause. He surely has his own evil-minded agenda. You should not forget that he was (he is still?) a KGB officer. You just can’t expect his mentality has really changed. Yes, KGB has changed its name but not the substance and not its mentality and purpose. Putin’s state machine is not yet running at a full steam. There would be a lot more deaths and imprisonments in the near future.This article by Irvin Studin is both amusing and appalling. In spite of the academic credentials of the gentleman, he shows a very limited knowledge of recent events in Ukraine. If he were to follow the events, he would find that “Pravy Sector” joined the people’s revolution at the very end of opposition; they also were almost non-visible at that time. Furthermore, although they are truly the most rightist of the revolutionaries, they constitute about 1 per cent of support in Ukraine; hardly a force. How does Mr. Studin know the extent of their armament? If one considers sidearms, guns, batons, Molotov cocktails and rifles, this is hardly strong enough against the 40,000 Russian troops settled on the border of east Ukraine. The writer is bemoaning the “illegal” election of the temporary government, although he seems conveniently to forget Russia’s illegal break of UN Constitution, the Budapest Accord, etc., in annexing Crimea.I was truly shocked by the malice and willful ignorance shown in this article. No mention is made of the fact that the Maidan revolution deposed one of the most corrupt regimes that flaunted all constitutional laws, violated human rights by selective prosecution, amassed vast illegal fortunes and brought the economy of the country to ruin. To add absurdity, the article suggests that “Russia … knows Ukraine far better than any other country,” implying that it was justified in illegally annexing Crimea. The author would also have you believe that the existence of a small and relatively insignificant group known as the Right Sector somehow implies that the current government of Ukraine is less democratic than the despotic ruler of Russia.Knowing several of the cabinet members personally and the overall composition of the Provisional Government, this assertion is absolutely false. The Canadian government, in supporting the freedom loving people of Ukraine, is fully in step with the rest of the world, which recognizes Putin for the potential threat to world peace he represents.The article illustrates the pervasive disinformation the Russian regime tries to disseminate even in the halls of academia.Yanukovych and his fellow kleptocrats grabbed what they could carry and fled the country of their own accord, catching the opposition and the protest movement by surprise — which helps to explain some of the chaos that followed. It is equally ludicrous to credit Pravy Sektor for escalating the violence unleashed on the Maidan by the regime (after two months of massive, disciplined and peaceful protests), or to attribute any great influence to their small and dubious membership.Irvin Studin questions the legitimacy of the current interim government of Ukraine, which is at variance with Canada’s official position, but coincides more or less with that of the government of Russia. Yet, the current Ukrainian government that came to power did so only after the elected president, Viktor Yanukovych, fled to Russia, which with his blessing subsequently occupied and annexed Crimea and continues to threaten to invade Ukraine’s mainland. Bearing in mind that any country’s leader has to first of all fulfil his duties, obey the constitution, and work to defend and protect his country, does Mr. Studin suggest that Mr. Yanukovych still retains some legitimacy? Moreover, the interim government was installed following a vote in parliament that constituted a constitutional majority. It has also announced new elections for president on May 25. In a revolutionary situation, this seems to be about as legitimate as it can get.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…The Star's Public Editor welcomes reader comments and complaints about news and feature content in the print and online editions. 
				Crimean Tatar women protest against the country's breakup outside Simferopol, Ukraine on Friday.
			OTTAWA—Prime Minister Stephen Harper will visit Ukraine next week to express support for the interim government in the midst of its unfolding crisis with Russia.“Canada remains united with its allies in recognizing the government of Ukraine, and in supporting Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” Harper said Friday in a statement announcing the trip.Canada, the U.S. and other western countries have threatened sanctions against Russia if President Vladimir Putin allows the Crimean referendum, which the West has denounced as an illegitimate violation of Ukrainian sovereignty.Harper is the first leader of from a G7 country to announce plans to visit Ukraine during the current unrest there. With Russian troops conducting exercises on Ukraine’s border and the country wracked by political tension and violent demonstrations, Harper could find himself in the midst of a chaotic situation next week.“We have been unsuccessful to date at finding a diplomatic solution, a political solution, to this issue,” Foreign Minister John Baird told a press conference Friday, when asked if Harper might find it hard to play a productive role in the impasse in Ukraine. Harper will visit Ukraine as part of a European swing that will take him to the Nuclear Security Summit in the Netherlands from March 24-25, and to Berlin for an official visit with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on March 26-27. Merkel, considered the West’s best contact with Putin, has said a failure by the Russian government to halt the referendum in Crimea will be a “catastrophe.”Baird, who said he spent much of the day in discussions with his U.S. and European counterparts on Ukraine, said it appears Putin does not realize the gravity of the situation Moscow has set in motion through its military presence in Crimea.“I cannot stress clearly enough that it will not be business as usual” with Russia unless Putin reverses course, Baird said. “The international community will not recognize the stunt of a referendum that now threatens to turn from an invasion to an annexation” of Crimea, he added.Baird said Canada is worried about the possibility of further military incursions in Ukraine by Putin once the Crimean referendum is over.President Barack Obama, Harper and other western leaders are engaged in a fierce diplomatic effort to convince Moscow to step back from the brink of the crisis, which has emerged as potentially the worst geopolitical standoff in decades.Baird said the western allies are preparing “contingencies and options” in the event that Crimea breaks away from Ukraine. While western leaders have ruled out military action, they have warned they will isolate Russia internationally if Putin does not reverse course.Canada has recalled its ambassador from Moscow, committed to join an international military observers mission in Ukraine and suspended all previously planned military exercises with Russia. Financial sanctions have been taken by Ottawa against 18 members of former president Viktor Yanukovych’s regime and Ottawa has backed out of planning for the G8 leaders’ summit in Sochi this summer.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…

			Russian President Vladimir Putin effectively wrests control of Crimea from Kiev, as Russia’s parliament votes to approve sending troops into the region citing security interests.KYIV, UKRAINE—Russia’s parliament approved a motion to use the country’s military in Ukraine after a request from President Vladimir Putin as protests in Russian-speaking cities turned violent Saturday, sparking fears of a wide-scale invasion.The motion follows President Barack Obama’s warning Friday “there will be costs” if Russia intervenes militarily, sharply raising the stakes in the conflict over Ukraine’s future and evoking memories of Cold War brinkmanship.“I’m submitting a request for using the armed forces of the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine pending the normalization of the socio-political situation in that country,” Putin said in his request sent to parliament.Ukraine had already accused Russia on Friday of a “military invasion and occupation” in the strategic peninsula of Crimea where Russia’s Black Sea fleet is based. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk called on Moscow “to recall their forces, and to return them to their stations,” according to the Interfax news agency. “Russian partners, stop provoking civil and military resistance in Ukraine.”Why Ukraine is not the Cold War revisited: BurmanThe crisis was sparked when Ukraine’s deposed president, Victor Yanukovych, ditched a deal for closer ties to the European Union and instead turned toward Moscow. Months of protests followed, culminating in security forces killing dozens of protesters and Yanukovych fleeing to Russia.Ignoring Obama’s warning, Putin said the “extraordinary situation in Ukraine” was putting at risk the lives of Russian citizens and military personnel stationed at a naval base that Moscow has maintained in the Black Sea peninsula since the Soviet collapse.Putin’s call came as pro-Russian demonstrations broke out in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking east, where protesters raised Russian flags and beat up supporters of the new Ukrainian government.Putin’s motion loosely refers to the “territory of Ukraine” rather than specifically to Crimea, raising the possibility that Moscow could use military force in other Russian-speaking provinces in eastern and southern Ukraine, where many oppose the new authorities in Kyiv. Pro-Russian protests were reported in the eastern cities of Kharkiv, Donetsk and Luhansk and the southern port of Odesa.Ukraine’s population is divided in loyalties between Russia and Europe, with much of western Ukraine advocating closer ties with the European Union while eastern and southern regions look to Russia for support. Crimea, a semi-autonomous region of Ukraine, is mainly Russian-speaking.In Saturday’s parliamentary session in Moscow, a deputy house speaker said Obama had insulted Russia and crossed a “red line,” and the upper house recommended the Russian ambassador in Washington be recalled. It will be up to Putin to decide whether that happens.In Crimea, the pro-Russian prime minister who took office after gunmen seized the regional Parliament claimed control of the military and police there and asked Putin for help in keeping peace, sharpening the discord between the two neighbouring Slavic countries.Ukraine’s acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, said the election of Sergei Aksyonov as prime minister of Crimea was invalid.Crimea only became part of Ukraine in 1954 when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred jurisdiction from Russia, a move that was a mere formality when both Ukraine and Russia were part of the Soviet Union. The Soviet breakup in 1991 meant Crimea landed in an independent Ukraine.Russia put pressure on Ukraine from another direction when a spokesman for state gas company Gazprom said that Ukraine owed $1.59 billion in overdue bills for imported gas. Sergei Kuprianov was quoted by the RIA-Novosti agency as saying the gas arrears would endanger a recent discount granted by Russia. The discount lowered the price to $268.50 per thousand from other $400. The Russian payment demand and loss of the discount would accelerate Ukraine’s financial crisis. The county is almost broke and seeking emergency credit from the International Monetary Fund.Russia has taken a confrontational stance toward its southern neighbour after Yanukovych fled the country. Yanukovych was voted out of office by parliament after weeks of protests ended in violence that left more than 80 people dead.Aksyonov, the Crimea leader, appealed to Putin “for assistance in guaranteeing peace and calmness on the territory of the autonomous republic of Crimea.” Aksyonov was voted in by the Crimean parliament on Thursday after pro-Russia gunmen seized the building and as tensions soared over Crimea’s resistance to the new authorities in Kyiv, who took office this week.Obama called on Russia to respect the independence and territory of Ukraine and not try to take advantage of its neighbour, which is undergoing political upheaval.He said such action by Russia would represent a “profound interference” in matters he said must be decided by the Ukrainian people.“The United States will stand with the international community in affirming that there will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine,” he said. Obama did not say what those costs might be.At the United Nations, the Ukrainian ambassador, Yuriy Sergeyev, said Friday that Russian transport aircraft and 11 attack helicopters had arrived in Crimea illegally, and that Russian troops had taken control of two airports in Crimea.He described the gunmen posted outside the two airports as Russian armed forces as well as “unspecified” units.Meanwhile, flights remained halted from Simferopol’s airport. Dozens of armed men in military uniforms without markings patrolled the area. They didn’t stop or search people leaving or entering the airport, and refused to talk to journalists.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				Ukrainians rally outside the parliament in Kyiv on Feb. 27, the same day deposed Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych declared that he still considered himself to be Ukraine's head of state.
			MOSCOW—The guest book at the Hotel Ukraine includes the names of actors Robert De Niro and Marcello Mastroianni.The name that didn’t appear there on Thursday was Viktor Yanukovych — fugitive most-wanted and, until last Saturday, Kremlin-backed president of Ukraine. Yet Russian newspaper and news agency RBC stated the toppled and on-the-run strongman had been ensconced in one of the massive hotel’s 900 rooms for one or two nights this week, allegedly arriving Tuesday evening.Never officially checked-in and never officially checked-out but, according to reports from several domestic media outlets, came and went without being noticed — a heavy police presence was obvious outside the neo-Stalinist building Thursday — and was last reported to have removed himself to the Barvikha Sanitorium, a luxury health resort on the outskirts of the capital, where Yanukovych can enjoy sauna, solarium and spa, or go for a hike. Yanukovych did, however, release a blustering statement Thursday, read on Russian TV and provided to major news agencies: “I, Viktor Fedorovych Yanukovych, am addressing the people of Ukraine. I still believe myself to be the legitimate head of the Ukrainian state elected in a free vote by Ukrainian citizens.”The deposed autocrat — exotic private zoo animals and staggeringly ornate possessions left behind, so lickety-split was his exit — said he had requested and been given Russian protection against “extremists.” Moscow tacitly substantiated this claim, not mentioning Yanukovych specifically but noting that anybody holding a Ukrainian passport can cross the border without restriction and their security would be assured.Whether Muscovites have much sympathy for the despot appears doubtful. Cellphone video posted from a hockey game played here Thursday night depicts a crowd loudly chanting: GLORY TO UKRAINE! GLORY TO THE HEROES!The citizenry may simply not want their government dragging Russia into any further military involvement in its former republics, four years after Moscow went to war briefly with breakaway South Ossetia in Georgia. The whole country is on edge over those war games — “snap military drills” as Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu describes suspiciously timed manoeuvres, with 150,000 troops activated in the western district abutting semi-autonomous Crimea — where unidentified men reportedly armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket-propelled grenades seized control of the Supreme Council building in the capital, Simferopol, raising the Russian flag.  President Vladimir Putin has stated that Moscow continues to view Yanukovych — Russia’s staunch ally until events in Kyiv unfolded with stunning speed — as Ukraine’s rightful leader, bludgeoned from power by radicals. Russia has refused to recognize the new Ukrainian government and persists in denouncing Yanukovych’s ouster as an illegitimate coup.Yanukovych has vowed to break his silence — and surface publicly — at a press conference Friday in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, 110 kilometres from the Ukrainian border. Ukraine wants him extradited from wherever he may be and brought before the International Criminal Court to face trial for the violence that left 82 people dead in Kyiv last week.There is also the matter of $70 billion missing from Ukraine’s treasury, the interim government revealed Thursday, accusing Yanukovych and his cronies of siphoning the money into offshore accounts.Many observers are surprised that Yanukovych took refuge in Russia, though his options were clearly limited. He had been severely criticized by Russian politicians for fleeing in hasty night-flight rather than holding the ground that was crumbling beneath his feet. It’s unclear whether Russia still has any faith in its erstwhile ally but it has palpably taken his side in the escalating tensions over Crimea — with its large Russian-speaking and Russia-beseeching population. Sevastopol, in the Crimean peninsula, hosts Russia’s Black Sea Fleet under an agreement worked out between capitals. Seven armoured personnel carriers, believed to be Russian, showed up briefly in Sevastopol Thursday.Diplomacy is struggling to keep pace with fast-moving developments on the ground, Russia emphatically declaring it will protect its compatriots inside Ukraine and the United States warning Moscow to stay out of it. Via Twitter microblog, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said Thursday it would defend the rights of its compatriots in the Ukrainian in a “strong and uncompromising” manner. While Russian jets patrolled the border Thursday night, Moscow appeared — beneath the sabre-rattling rhetoric — more willing than not to step back from the brink and allow the situation to stabilize, if NATO likewise cools off provocative hyperbole. Ukraine’s new prime minister, Arseniy Yatseniuk, pleaded for time and space to resolve the crisis politically, urging Russia not to place “boots on the ground.”Yanukovych surfacing for the media on Friday is unlikely to pacify adversaries or sooth hostilities.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				Newly appointed Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, left, speaks to newly appointed members of parliament during a first meeting of the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers in Kyiv on Thursday.
			Top figures in Ukraine’s three-month protest are taking up powerful posts in the new Cabinet, underscoring the powerful and unpredictable force of the revolt. But while few doubt the leaders’ resolve, the nominations have raised questions about their skills and expertise — especially given the enormous challenges the new government faces.For many of these leaders, the government posts represent a political and personal victory. But they also present an enormous responsibility as the nation seeks to heal and rebuild after over 80 people were killed in the protests.Bulatov’s kidnapping in January shocked Ukrainians and added further energy to the protests. It helped to turn demonstrations calling for closer ties with the West into a broader movement for human rights and the ouster of President Viktor Yanukvoych.Bulatov, 35, a leader of a group of angry motorists, spent more than a week in captivity. He said he was beaten and nailed to a door, and that he begged his attackers to kill him to spare him of the pain. On Thursday, parliament voted to approve Bulatov as sports and youth minister.“We are building a civilized society, there is no desire to grab a seat or a portfolio,” he told a Ukrainian television channel. “The system will have to be rebuilt from the ground up.”Oleh Musiy, a top medic in the protesters’ volunteer medical team, spent three months treating hundreds of demonstrators injured in the clashes in makeshift clinics set up in a city library, a church and other locations. Many activists were kidnapped and detained in government-run hospitals so they preferred to be treated by protesters’ medics. As Musiy prepared to assume the post of health minister, he admitted he was nervous about his job.“I think it will get even harder now because the health care system is in a horrible state and has to be reformed very seriously and be made friendly to the people,” Musiy told the Associated Press in a telephone interview.As he dressed activists’ wounds and counted the dead, he never imagined that he would end up in government.“Of course, I never planned this. And even now I have my doubts as to whether I need this,” he said. “They didn’t really ask me. If it is necessary and if I have the people’ trust, then I think that with the help of my team, chances are high that changes will happen.”For months, actor Yevhen Nishchuk was one of the most recognizable faces and voices of the protest, introducing opposition speakers on a giant stage on Kyiv’s Independence Square, or the Maidan, singing the national anthem along with crowds of tens and hundreds of thousands and instructing protesters to remain calm when police tried to storm the camp.Appearing in the Ukrainian parliament before the vote on Thursday, he sought to allay concerns that he was not up to the job of Culture Minister.“Some say that it’s a negative thing I am just an actor and all the rest of it, that I am not an administrator, not a manager, but a lot was achieved over this period thanks also to my organizational skills,” Nishchuk told the AP. “For the past twenty years the Culture Ministry only worked to make sure that a president’s visit is accompanied by a basket of flowers. This is horrible, this must be changed.”The photos of Tetyana Chernovil’s swollen, disfigured face made international headlines in December, after the investigative journalist and activist was beaten by a group of unknown assailants outside Kyiv, as she was returning home from the Maidan. This week, Chernovil, 34, who also took part in storming several government buildings during the protests, was tapped as head of an anti-corruption committee in the new government.Outside the parliament chamber on Thursday, she expressed joy at Maidan’s victory, but also acknowledged that she faced a hard job stamping out Ukraine’s endemic corruption.“This job is completely new to me. It’s one thing to be a journalist, it is a different thing to be a person who must stop this corruption,” Chernovil told AP, her face still showing scars and bruises from the beating. “I thought that victory would prevail, but I didn’t think it would come so soon, I thought this would take several years. I was absolutely convinced that I would not live to see that. So for me, this is something surreal.”Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…
				An armed man stands guard outside a police building seized by pro-Russian separatists in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk. More than a dozen kidnappings have been reported in the region, according to the Kyiv Post.
			“The people who have taken over our cities are the bottom of society. Thugs, low-lifes. I believe the killing of (city councillor Volodymyr) Rybak was to send a message of terror to all of us. And I don’t accept it. If we are to look our children in the eyes, we have to resist.”KRAMATORSK, UKRAINE—It is difficult to predict days ahead, let alone an entire month, here in the lawless stretch of eastern Ukraine occupied by masked pro-Russia gunmen.But if the unstable status quo holds and May 25 arrives anything like today, the upcoming Ukrainian presidential election could unfold in ways most Canadians would not dare to watch up close and personal.Grisly context came this week with the discovery of two bodies floating in the Torets River near Kramatorsk — one belonging to local politician Volodymyr Rybak, a vocal opponent of the hostile takeover underway in Donetsk province.Rybak, a city councillor, was a rarity in these parts — a card-carrying member of the pro-western Batkivshchynya party. He was last seen alive at a pro-Ukraine rally in his home city of Horlivka, demanding that a separatist “Donetsk Republic” flag be removed from city hall. Soon thereafter he was snatched up by four masked gunmen, forced into a vehicle and driven away. The body was discovered wearing a backpack filled with sand and a massive, gaping wound across the stomach, according to a party official. It was later brought to the morgue in Slovyansk, where pro-Russian gunmen took control, both denying responsibility for the killing and also denying reporters’ requests to see the remains.The effect on Rybak’s fellow travellers is profound, as they ponder not only his terrible end but also a rash of similarly harrowing kidnaps, which now number 16, according to the latest tally from the Kyiv Post.“We are sickened by it. And I won’t lie to you — we are very afraid,” said Sergey Borozentsev, who leads the small Batkivshchynya faction in Kramatorsk.“The people who have taken over our cities are the bottom of society. Thugs, low-lifes. I believe the killing of Rybak was to send a message of terror to all of us. And I don’t accept it. If we are to look our children in the eyes, we have to resist.”Yet Borozentsev is under no illusion about the upcoming election. Even if the region limps through to May 25 without further bloodshed, the task of organizing a comprehensive vote in the midst of armed insurgency presents “a very great deal of concern.”The question is more than academic for Canada, now that the Harper government has pledged to aggressively monitor the upcoming elections with a deployment of up to 500 observers.In announcing the $9-million effort Wednesday, Employment Minister Jason Kenney, standing in as Foreign Minister John Baird travelled in eastern Europe, extended the tub-thumping message that Canada has maintained since the Ukraine crisis began.Kenney said he’s not worried about the Canadian presence antagonizing the Kremlin. Nor would he rule out the possibility that Canadian observers would find themselves here in east Ukraine.“It is not Canada that is provoking the Russian Federation. It is the Russian Federation that is provoking the democratic world by so obviously undermining the sovereignty of an independent member state of the United Nations,” he said.Another government official, speaking anonymously, told the Star’s Bruce Campion-Smith that “the observer mission would be planned in conjunction with officials on the ground, including those at the Canadian Embassy, to assess risks and take the required precautions.”One risk that exists today, reporters here have learned, is speaking English in public. With pro-Russian handbills that circulate through the region amplifying fears of nefarious CIA meddling, the sound of American English (Ukrainian ears make no distinction between Canadian and American) can provoke hostile glares. That hostility is exacerbated by insurgents’ removal of Ukrainian television signals in nearly a dozen occupied cities, leaving local viewers wholly dependent on the news flow from America-bashing Russian state television. “The men who took our buildings are, in my view, ignorant people. But the information war is far more sophisticated. The work of clever people with no morality,” Borozentsev told the Star. “If we make it to elections, at least that will mean the Russians have not invaded. But May 25 presents a real possibility of even more problems. We all hope not, but God only knows.”Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…Prices are provided by the merchants.

			KYIV, UKRAINE—Anxieties that Ukraine is poised to lose its prized Crimean peninsula forever deepened sharply Thursday as Russia’s high-stakes military occupation gave way to a campaign to annex the region.Awakening to a fresh political bombshell — Crimea’s decision to hold a referendum on joining the Russian Federation in just 10 days — western leaders spent the day chasing their diplomatic tails, with little to show by nightfall.The European Union and the United States rushed to announce a modest array of “costs” — varying measures that included visa bans and the targeted freezing of assets of Russian individuals complicit in the project to carve Crimea away from Ukraine. Though open-ended, the measures fell far short of the withering economic sanctions urged by many of Kyiv’s new leaders. Some in the Ukrainian capital interpreted the western response as a message that Europe is satisfied to let Crimea slip away if it means Russia will back away from deeper military incursions into other heavily Russified parts of Ukraine.President Barack Obama later spent an hour on the phone with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, warning against the “illegal” incursion into Crimea, detailing the latest sanctions and appealing for a return to direct talks to address “the interests of Russia, the people of Ukraine and the international community,” the White House said in a statement.But there was little indication diplomacy was gaining traction. Late Thursday the Kremlin issued a statement defending its action in Ukraine “as a result of an anti-constitutional coup that does not have a national mandate.”That came as Russian forces in Crimea worked to consolidate control with a series of actions, including the deliberate scuttling of one of their own ships, a rusting Soviet-era anti-submarine cruiser, to blockade Ukrainian navy ships deployed in the harbour Novoozeme.International observers, meanwhile, were harassed for a second straight day when a group of gunmen refused entry to a group of 40 military monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe as they attempted to enter Crimea by road. Crimea’s newly appointed prime minister, Sergey Aksyonov, moved to strip two independent Ukrainian television stations from the airwaves, ordering that Russian state-owned broadcasters begin transmitting in their place. The move sparked immediate protest from the Committee to Protect Journalists.But all that was overshadowed by the Aksyonov government’s decision to formally request union with Russia — and to put that question to a Crimean public ballot on March 16.Aksyonov’s deputy premier followed with an announcement that Crimea was ready to adopt the Russian ruble as its currency and “nationalize” all Ukrainian state property.The moves came as a shock to Crimea’s non-Russian minorities. Refat Chubarov, leader of Crimea’s Tatar community, took to Facebook, writing: “They are simply mad. It is obvious that they are following somebody else’s wishes. Good sense has abandoned them.” Chubarov later urged Tatars, believed to represent some 12 per cent of Crimea’s two million residents, to boycott the referendum.Ukrainian opposition politician Yulia Tymoshenko condemned the decision as “a referendum at gunpoint,” saying it would serve only to undermine both Ukrainian and global stability. If there is any irony in this latest twist, it is that Crimea, as the only of Ukraine’s provinces with a clear Russian majority — by some counts, 58 per cent — might well choose alignment with the mother country, even without the presence of armed troops. “Crimea is not Ukraine. Crimea is not Russia. Crimea is Crimea. We would be happy on our own if they let us,” Natasha Kuchma, 24, an electronics clerk, said Wednesday in the regional capital of Simferopol.No such option will be offered to Crimeans according to the wording of the planned referendum, a simple either/or question on endorsing annexation to Russia or remaining with the status quo as a semi-autonomous part of Ukraine.Yet the heavy-handed approach of Russia and its pro-Russian sponsors in Crimea may yet galvanize Ukrainians outside Crimea against Moscow. In Kyiv late Thursday, a sombre crowd on Independence Square alternately fretted and fumed at both the speed and manner in which the Crimean question was being forced upon them.Beset by financial crisis and braced for a wave of bad economic news as their new government readies to acquiesce to unpopular reforms as a condition of international financial rescue, many Ukrainians described the situation in Crimea as one crisis too many.“I feel sick. I could cry. I joined the Maidan to stand against corruption, not to push against Russians or push Crimea away,” said Katrina Yehorenko, one among thousands who strode the charred square Thursday, absorbing and sharing the day’s news.“We love Crimea. Our problems, their problems. They are the same. We are the same.”We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

The S&P 500 index slid 15.21 points to 1,863.4.Russia’s foreign minister has accused the West of plotting to control Ukraine and also announced military exercises near Ukraine’s border. And late Friday afternoon, Ukraine’s deputy foreign minister said he feared an imminent Russian invasion. Danylo Lubkivskye spoke as an official in Ukraine confirmed that pro-Russian forces had detained a team of military observers with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.At the same time, the economic cost to Russia for its stance toward Ukraine increased as Standard & Poor’s cut Russia’s credit rating from BBB to BBB-minus — one step above non-investment grade.S&P said it took the step because the tense situation “could see additional significant outflows of capital from the Russian economy.”The latest escalation in tensions came at the end of what had been a generally positive week on markets thanks to better than expected corporate earnings in Canada and the United States.In Canada, business software provider Open Text Corp. posted quarterly net earnings of $45.8 million or 33 cents per share, up from $25.8 million or 22 cents in the comparable year-earlier period as revenue rose to $442.8 million from $337.7 million. The company also upped its quarterly dividend by 15 per cent to 17.25 cents a share.

Its shares fell 88 cents or 3.65 per cent to $23.25 (Cdn.).May copper was unchanged at $3.12 a pound and the base metals group was up 0.4 per cent.The gold sector was the leading advancer, up about 2.4 per cent as geopolitical worries drove June bullion up $10.20 to $1,300.80 an ounce.Indexes closed little changed this week with the TSX up 33 points and the Dow industrials down 47 points.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

			The whereabouts and legitimacy of President Viktor Yanukovych are unclear after he left the capital for his support base in eastern Ukraine. He maintains that parliament’s decisions in recent days are illegal, and a top presidential aide told The Associated Press on Sunday that he will continue to fulfill his presidential duties.The newly emboldened parliament, now dominated by the opposition, struggled Sunday to work out who is in charge of the country and its ailing economy. Parliament, in a special session Sunday, voted overwhelmingly to temporarily hand the president’s powers to speaker Oleksandr Turchinov, a top ally of Tymoshenko. Ukraine’s future hangs in the balanceFears percolated that some regions might try to break away, after three months of political crisis that has left scores of people dead in a country of strategic importance to the United States, European nations and Russia.Ukraine is deeply divided between eastern regions that are largely pro-Russian and western areas that widely detest Yanukovych and long for closer ties with the European Union. Yanukovych’s shelving of an agreement with the EU in November set off the wave of protests, but they quickly expanded their grievances to corruption, human rights abuses and calls for Yanukovych’s resignation.The Kiev protest camp at the center of the anti-Yanukovych movement filled with more and more dedicated demonstrators Sunday, setting up new tents after two days that saw a stunning reversal of fortune in Ukraine’s political crisis.Tymoshenko, the blond-braided heroine of Ukraine’s 2004 Orange Revolution, increasingly appears to have the upper hand in the political battle, winning the backing Sunday of a leading Russian lawmaker and congratulations from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. senators on her release.Tymoshenko’s name circulated Sunday as a possibility for acting prime minister pending May 25 presidential elections, but she issued a statement via her party Sunday asking her supporters not to nominate her for the position.Russia’s position will be important for the future of this country, since Moscow has been providing financing to keep Ukraine’s economy afloat, and the two countries have deep but complicated ties.The Kremlin has been largely silent about whether it still supports Yanukovych. President Vladimir Putin, who is presiding over the close of the Sochi Olympics, has not spoken about recent events in Kiev.Russia’s finance minister on Sunday urged Ukraine to seek a loan from the International Monetary Fund to avoid an imminent default. Russia in December offered Ukraine a $15 billion bailout, but so far has provided only $3 billion, freezing further disbursements pending the outcome of the ongoing political crisis.Tensions mounted in Crimea, where pro-Russian politicians are organizing rallies and forming protest units and have been demanding autonomy from Kiev. Russia maintains a big naval base in Crimea that has tangled relations between the countries for two decades.The political crisis in this nation of 46 million has changed with blinding speed repeatedly in the past week. First there were signs that tensions were easing, followed by horrifying violence and then a deal signed under pressure from European diplomats that aimed to resolve the conflict — but left the unity of the country in question.The parliament, in a special session Sunday, voted overwhelmingly to temporarily hand the president’s powers to speaker Oleksandr Turchinov, a top ally of Tymoshenko.The legitimacy of the parliament’s flurry of decisions in recent days is under question. The votes are based on a decision Friday to return to a 10-year-old constitution that grants parliament greater powers. Yanukovych has not signed that decision into law, and he said Saturday that the parliament is now acting illegally.However, legal experts said that de facto the parliament is now in charge.Ihor Koliushko, head of the Center for Political and Legal Reform, said that given the president’s absence from Kiev and the exceptional situation, “I think it would be right to say that we don’t have a head of the state, but the president’s duties are being carried out ... by the head of the Verkhovna Rada,” or parliament.Yanukovych, who spoke on television Saturday in Kharkiv, accused his opponents of trying to overthrow the government.Presidential aide Hanna Herman told The Associated Press on Sunday that Yanukovych was in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv as of Saturday night and plans to stay in power. Still, Herman sought to distance herself from him somewhat Sunday, as did his party.In Kyiv’s protest camp, self-defense units that have taken control of the capital peacefully changed shifts Sunday. Helmeted and wearing makeshift shields, they have replaced police guarding the president’s administration and parliament, and have sought to stop radical forces from inflicting damage or unleashing violence.Ukrainians’ loyalties remain divided. Emotions mounted around statues of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin, after angry protesters took them down in several towns and cities. On Sunday, some pro-Russian protesters took up positions to defend Lenin statues in Donetsk and Kharkiv. Statues of Lenin across the former U.S.S.R. are seen as a symbol of Moscow’s rule.Tymoshenko, whose diadem of blond peasant braids and stirring rhetoric attracted world attention in the 2004 Orange Revolution, spoke late Saturday night to a crowd of about 50,000 on Kyiv’s Independence Square.She praised the protesters who were killed this week in clashes with police that included sniper fire and entreating the living to keep the camp going.“You are heroes. You are the best thing in Ukraine!” she said of the victims.The Health Ministry said the death toll in clashes between protesters and police that included sniper attacks had reached 82 over the last week. The protesters put that figure at over 100.European officials urged calm. Ukraine’s defense and military officials also called for Ukrainians to stay peaceful but did not clearly come on the side of the president or opposition.The past week has seen the worst violence in Ukraine since the breakup of the Soviet Union a quarter-century ago.

				Ukrainian Army troops muster on the outskirts of Izyum, in eastern Ukraine, on Tuesday. An Associated Press reporter saw at least 14 armored personnel carriers with Ukrainian flags, one helicopter and military trucks parked 40 km north of the city on Tuesday.
			WASHINGTON—A Ukrainian military crackdown on the country’s restive east triggered a grave new assessment from Russia Tuesday, with Moscow denouncing the move as a radical escalation that “puts Ukraine on the brink of civil war.”The ominous words came in a Kremlin statement attributed to Vladimir Putin as the Russian President balked at the day’s developments in a telephone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of crisis talks scheduled for Thursday in Geneva. But beneath the high-level sabre-ratting, a high-risk operation unfolded on the ground as Ukrainian military units crept cautiously eastward toward a cluster of nearly 10 cities and towns in Ukraine’s industrial rust belt to reclaim territory lost to pro-Russian opponents.Oleksandr Turchynov, acting president of the fragile government in Kyiv, told parliament that Ukrainian forces had recaptured the airport in the eastern town of Kramatorsk and launched a second operation in nearby Slovyansk “to protect citizens from terrorists who are trying to tear this country apart.”An Associated Press team reported gunfire during the confrontation over Kramatorsk airport amid conflicting reports of casualties. Russia media said between four and 15 people were killed; other pro-Russian sources on the ground told AP of two injured and none dead.A cluster of online videos showed pro-Russian activists assembling barricades outside the airport in a bid to contain Ukrainian troops inside. One reporter on the scene, Ilya Azar, said the standoff later devolved into a drunken spectacle, with some inebriated protesters crawling forward as Ukrainian soldiers fired warning shots skyward.“The drunks crawled over to the soldiers, who are shooting in the air. And then they talked without shooting,” journalist Azar tweeted. “The drunks could not explain coherently what they were talking about.”But the day’s events came amid other sobering messages, including a declaration by former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko that Ukraine is already engaged in de facto war with Russia. “We have to tell Ukrainians the truth: the Russian Federation is waging a real war against Ukraine in the east, in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in particular,” said Tymoshenko, who is bidding for a return to power in upcoming May 25 presidential elections.Tymoshenko also called for the creation of an armed “national resistance movement” to augment Ukrainian security forces, saying, “there is a need to create special teams in every city.”Russia has denied any role in the eastern uprisings, which are playing out with echoes of the carefully co-ordinated ouster of Ukrainian forces from Crimea in March.Ukrainian officials on Tuesday claimed a direct link in the sequence of destabilization, identifying a Russian foreign intelligence agent, Igor Strelkov, as a leader of the pro-Russian provocateurs in Slovyansk. Ukraine’s security services say the same agent was also involved in the seizure of Ukrainian military facilities in Crimea.Tuesday’s Ukrainian troop movements included a blockade of Slavyansk, a city in the control pro-Russian separatists since Saturday. A Ukrainian commander on the ground said the militants were reinforced by several hundred soldiers from the Russian army’s Main Intelligence Directorate.But in steadfastly denying the accusations, Russian leaders insisted the reverse was true — and warned that Ukrainian military operations would effectively doom the Geneva talks involving Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union.“You can’t send in tanks and at the same time hold talks. The use of force would sabotage the opportunity offered by the four-party negotiations in Geneva,” said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.As many as 40,000 Russian troops remain clustered along eastern positions on the border, a presence that Ukrainians have warned could soon become an invasion. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, meanwhile, tabled a report Tuesday warning that the propaganda and incitement must urgently be countered in order to prevent escalation in Ukraine.The UN report confirmed an element of Moscow’s argument about attacks against ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine. But it said that the attacks were “neither systematic nor widespread.” The report also noted allegations that “some participants in the protests and clashes in eastern Ukraine were not from the region, and that some had come from the Russian Federation.”Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…
				Masked pro-Russia activists wait to prevent planned visit of presidential candidate Yulia Tymoshenko to the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk on April 22, 2014.
			Ukraine has restarted a military offensive in the eastern part of the country after two brutally beaten bodies were discovered in the Donetsk region — one is thought to be a local politician.Acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov said the politician’s name is Vladimir Rybak, reports the BBC.“The terrorists who effectively took the whole Donetsk region hostage have now gone too far,” the BBC reported Turchynov saying.Two “brutally tortured individuals” have been found near Sloviansk, in the Donetsk region where pro-Russian separatists have been strategically taking over key government buildings, Turchynov said in a statement reported by the Kyiv Post.The move by Ukraine comes as Joseph Biden, U.S. vice-president, visited Kyiv to show American support for Ukraine and to denounce the Russian takeover of Crimea. “We do not recognize Russia’s actions in the Crimea. Here in Ukraine, people know that it is about something much more fundamental. It isn’t about geopolitics, it is about unity, it is about independence and at its most basic level it is about restoring respect and dignity,” Biden said.Biden, once again, demanded Russia respect international law, specifically the April 17 agreement to ease tensions reached in Geneva between Ukraine, Russia, the U.S. and the European Union. Many of the pro-Russian militants operating in the Donetsk region are thought to be backed by the Russian government. However, Russian officials have denied this and the militants say they are not bound by the Geneva agreement.On a Ukrainian government website, Turchynov said in a statement: “I demand from security task forces to resume and carry fruitful counterterrorism actions meant for protection of Ukrainian citizens, who live in the east of Ukraine, against the terrorists.”Calling it a terrorist move, Turchynov said they had “overstepped the limits” by torturing and killing patriots of Ukraine.“They dared to toss a challenge not just to our country, but to the whole world as well, when they demonstratively outraged upon the decisions, which have been adopted in Geneva. These crimes are committed under the complete favour and with the connivance of the Russian Federation,” he said.Meanwhile, in Moscow, the highest ranking Canadian diplomat has been asked to leave the country in 14 days, said the Russian news service Itar-Tass.Canadian officials were told Tuesday the embassy’s First Secretary Margarita Atanasov would be expelled from Russia in the next two weeks, reported Itar-Tass.The move is seen as a retaliatory gesture after the Canadian government asked a military attaché to leave Ottawa earlier this month, for unknown reasons.U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden was in Kyev Tuesday, where he pledged Washington's support for Ukraine as a Cold War-style confrontation over the former Soviet republic ratchets up.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				  Terms and Conditions.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…KYIV, Ukraine—About 50,000 demonstrators rallied in the centre of Kyiv Sunday to demand that Ukraine’s government reverse course and sign a landmark agreement with the European Union in defiance of Russia.The protest was the biggest Ukraine has seen since the peaceful 2004 Orange Revolution, which overturned a fraudulent presidential election result and brought a Western-leaning government to power.This rally was led by Ukraine’s top opposition figures, who called for the protests to continue until President Viktor Yanukovych agreed to sign the free trade and political association deal with the EU at a summit on Friday.As during the Orange Revolution, the opposition set up tents and encouraged supporters to spend the night. It was unclear how many would stay, with temperatures in the single digits and rain forecast.Sunday’s demonstration was sparked by anger over the government’s sudden move last week to pull out of the EU agreement and focus instead on trade ties with Russia, under strong pressure from Moscow.After the rally at European Square, dozens of protesters clashed with police and pro-Russia activists near the government building, while another standoff took place outside Yanukovych’s office. Police said they used tear gas at the government building after protesters threw a smoke bomb and refused to back off.A larger crowd of several thousand headed for nearby Independence Square, planning to continue the protest. Meanwhile, Yanukovych supporters held their own rally on another Kyiv square.The pro-EU demonstrators, carrying giant Ukrainian and EU flags, chanted “Ukraine is Europe” and sang the national anthem as they marched toward European Square for the rally.“Should we go toward Europe or toward Russia? It’s a choice between the past and the future,” opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a top ally of imprisoned former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, told the crowd.In an emotional letter read to demonstrators by her daughter, Tymoshenko called on Ukrainians to continue demonstrating until Yanukovych signed the EU deal.The protesters responded with chants of “Freedom to Yulia” and “Down with the gang,” a reference to Yanukovych and his government.EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele, who has been lobbying for the deal for years, indicated Sunday that the deal is still on the table. In a Twitter post written in English, Ukrainian and Russian, Fuele said, “Our commitment to modernization of Ukraine remains firm, door remains open, benefits 4 neighbours too, despite rhetoric.”One key EU demand for signing the deal is the release of Tymoshenko, whose imprisonment the West sees as politically driven. Yanukovych narrowly defeated Tymoshenko in the 2010 presidential election. He comes up for re-election in 2015, and Tymoshenko accuses him of keeping her behind bars to prevent her from running.Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…
				People applaud as the European Union flag held by a protester arrives at Independence square during a rally in Kyiv, Ukraine. (March 2, 2014)
			WASHINGTON—Western powers are prepared “to go to the hilt” to isolate Russia for its military incursion into Ukraine, “an incredible act of aggression” that may lead to visa bans, asset freezes, trade and investment penalties, and a boycott of a Russian-hosted economic summit of global powers in June, Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday.Kerry said Russian President Vladimir Putin should respect the democratic process through which the Ukrainian people ousted their pro-Russian president and assembled a new government.But President Barack Obama had pressed his case in a 90-minute phone call Saturday with Putin, calling Russia’s actions “a clear violation” of Ukraine’s sovereignty, and asking for his forces to pull back, and still the situation only grew more dire Sunday.Ukraine’s new prime minister warned that “we are on the brink of disaster,” while hundreds of armed men in trucks and armored vehicles surrounded a Ukrainian military base in Crimea.Despite the strong words Sunday from America’s top diplomat, the Obama administration struggled to find a response that would might deter Putin, who contends that the turmoil in its neighbor posed real threats to the life and health of Russian citizens living in Ukraine and that Moscow has the right to protect them.Kerry said he spoke on Saturday with foreign ministers from the Group of Eight countries and a few other nations, and “every single one of them are prepared to go to the gilt in order to isolate Russia” because of the invasion.“They’re prepared to put sanctions in place. They’re prepared to isolate Russia economically. The ruble is already going down. Russia has major economic challenges. I can’t imagine that an occupation of another country is something that appeals to a people who are trying to reach out to the world, and particularly if it involves violence,” Kerry said.Kerry also mentioned visa bans, the freezing of Russian assets, trade and investment penalties. He suggested American companies “may well want to start thinking twice about whether they want to do business with a country that behaves like this.”He said the U.S. was “absolutely prepared” to boycott the G-8 meeting planned for June in Sochi, Russia, site of the just-concluded Winter Olympics, “if we can’t resolve it otherwise.”Putin is “not going to have a Sochi G-8. He may not even remain in the G-8 if this continues,” Kerry said. Along with the potential loss of foreign business investment and other economic penalties, that would be “a huge price to pay,” Kerry said, calling Russia isolated. “That is not a position of strength.”The G-8 countries are the U.S., Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia.Kerry also said the administration was ready to provide economic assistance “of a major sort” to Ukraine.“The last thing anybody wants is a military option,” he said. “We want a peaceful resolution through the normal processes of international relations.”The U.S. and Europe are not obligated to come to Ukraine’s defense because it does not have full-member status in NATO. Broader international action through the United Nations seems all but impossible because of Russia’s veto power as a permanent member of the Security Council.Kerry was interviewed on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” NBC’s “Meet the Press” and ABC’s “This Week.”Emotions can run high when helping the k…Proper soil preparation in the garden is…In what is being called the “biggest crisis” of the 21st century in Europe, the western world is waiting to see if U.S. President Barack Obama has the teeth to take on the Kremlin over Crimea.In a last-ditch effort to defuse the political crisis threatening to destabilize Europe, Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, has called for an “extraordinary” meeting of all EU heads of state on Thursday in Brussels. The European Union, Russia’s biggest trading partner, is threatening to boycott the upcoming G8 summit in Sochi, Russia, and to freeze visa liberalization if Moscow doesn’t stop its takeover of Crimea and possible annexations in eastern Ukraine.In Washington, Obama hinted at coming economic sanctions. “Over time, this will be a costly proposition for Russia,” he said, according to the McClatchy-Tribune news service. He also asked Congress to make sure an aid package was the “first order of business.”But in Kyiv, the Russian threat is very real. Thousands of pro-European demonstrators, who stood in Kyiv’s Independence Square for three months and have formed the political movement known as Maidan or Euromaidan, are now readying themselves to defend Ukraine’s sovereignty. Maidan formed in late November to protest former president Viktor Yanukovych’s regime.“This movement will continue struggling against (Russian President Vladimir) Putin if it comes here. Maidan recognizes the dire need to prepare,” said Sviatoslav Yurash, Euromaidan’s international press secretary.“Maidan is trying to redefine itself . . . Kyiv is ours. The big struggle is in the east and the south . . . Putin has for years tried to get Ukraine back into his orbit. For him this is his last chance to get Ukraine back to Russia’s sphere,” Yurash said.British Foreign Secretary William Hague did not mince words during his visit to Kyiv, meant to show support for the fledging Ukrainian government. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is expected to do the same on Tuesday.This is the “biggest crisis” facing Europe in the 21st century, Hague said on the BBC. He called for urgent dialogue between Russia and Ukraine.“The world cannot just allow this to happen. The world cannot say it’s OK, in effect, to violate the sovereignty of another nation in this way,” Hague said from Kyiv.The United Nations held a special Security Council meeting in New York, at Russia’s request. However, as a permanent member, Russia holds veto power at the council so the UN’s role remains unclear.Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the UN, balked at Russia’s request while it flexed its military might. “One might think that Moscow has just become the rapid response arm of the High Commissioner for Human Rights,” Power said.Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Europe’s most powerful leader, spoke to Obama on Sunday after speaking with Putin. Merkel said she did not think Putin was in touch with reality and that he is “in another world,” the New York Times reported.On Tuesday, the North Atlantic Council, which includes all 28 North Atlantic Treaty Organization ambassadors, will hold an emergency meeting at Poland’s request. While Ukraine is not a NATO member, Poland sits on Ukraine’s western border. Russia’s aggression is deemed a security threat.Obama may have fumbled his foreign policy concerning Syria, but this time the stakes are higher as he deals with a nuclear-armed Russia, NATO obligations and an agreement made in 1994 called the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances. The memo was signed by Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the United Kingdom, acknowledging the denuclearization of Ukraine in exchange for the former Soviet bloc nation’s sovereignty.Apart from military intervention, which has largely been ruled out by the West, world leaders can only truly punish Putin by kicking him out of the G8 club and blacklisting the Russian economy.The heightened political tensions shook world financial markets. The Dow Jones industrial average sank Monday and U.S. stocks dipped during a global equities sell-off as investors nervously watched the unfolding conflict.Western unease and threats of sanctions against Russia caused Moscow markets to falter. Russia’s central bank increased its main interest rate 1.5 percentage points and the main RTS index in Moscow was down 12 per cent, the biggest drop in more than six years.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev visits a school in the Crimean capital Simferopol, on Monday.
			Russia's takeover of Crimea, a strategic Black Sea peninsula, and its attempts to compel constitutional changes in Ukraine have markedly raised tensions with the West and prompted fears that Moscow intends to invade other areas of Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met for more than four hours of talks Sunday on defusing the tensions, but made no apparent progress.“Russia's leadership should deal with problems in the Russian Federation, and not with Ukraine's problems,” Ukraine's acting president Oleksandr Turchinov said. “It is Ukrainians that should dictate the form of the new constitution and how the country is structured.”The concerns were stoked by the large numbers of troops Russia has placed along the Ukrainian border for what Moscow said were military exercises. On Monday, the Russian Defence Ministry said one of the battalions that had been sent to the Rostov border next to Ukraine was being withdrawn to its permanent base in the central Samara region, Russian news agencies said.Alexander Rozmaznin, deputy chief of the Ukrainian armed forces command centre, separately confirmed a drop in Russian troop numbers along the border.But making no mistake about Russia's view of the peninsula, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin tweeted a photo of himself upon arrival in Crimea with the words “Crimea is ours, and that's that.”Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March after a hastily called referendum held just two weeks after Russian forces had taken control the Black Sea region. Ukraine and the West have rejected the vote.The annexation after Ukraine's pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in February following months of protests. Russia claims the ouster was a coup and that the new Ukrainian authorities are nationalist fascists who will abuse Ukraine's large ethnic Russian population. The new government notes that Yanukovych himself left the country for Russia and there has been no harassment of Russian speakers.To keep its influence over eastern and southern Ukraine, which are heavily populated by ethnic Russians, Russia has pushed for Ukraine to become a federation where regions would have broad powers. The U.S. says it's up to Ukrainians to determine the structure of their government, not Moscow.Medvedev said Russia will create a special economic zone in Crimea — a peninsula of 2 million people — that will create incentives for business with lower taxes and simpler rules. Russia will also seek to develop the region as a top tourist destination and will try to ensure that plane tickets to Crimea are cheap enough to encourage more Russians to visit.Medvedev particularly emphasized the need to ensure a stable power supply for the peninsula. Crimea currently gets about 80 per cent of its electricity and a similar share of its water from Ukraine, and power cutoffs last week raised fears that the Ukrainian government could use energy as a weapon to bargain with Russia.Medvedev said Russia already has made sure that Crimea has enough backup power capacity to ensure an uninterrupted electricity supply. He added that Russia will work on long-term solutions to Crimea's energy problem that could involve linking the region to Russia's power grid or developing local power generation.He said efforts will also be made to quickly repair water infrastructure to reduce loss of water. In the future, Crimea could get water from Russia or create its own water reservoirs.Russia's defence minister, meanwhile, announced Monday that all Crimean men of conscription age will get a deferral from the draft for one year.In Moscow, the lower house of parliament voted unanimously Monday to annul agreements with Ukraine on Russia's navy base in Crimea. In 2010, Ukraine extended the lease of Russia's Black Sea Fleet's base until 2042 for an annual rent of $98 million and price discounts for Russian natural gas supplies.Medvedev has said Russia had given Ukraine $11 billion in gas discounts in advance and should claim the money back once the lease deal is repealed. If Moscow makes that move, it would further raise pressure on the cash-strapped Ukrainian government that now depends on Western loans to avoid bankruptcy.The United States and the European Union have slapped travel bans and asset freezes on members of Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle for the annexation of Crimea and warned that Russia will face even more painful sanctions if it tries to invade eastern Ukraine.But in a sign that Russian-U.S. talks could be inching toward a compromise, a senior Russian diplomat changed his tone Monday while speaking about Ukraine's May 25 presidential election, which the West has urged Moscow to recognize.Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies that the Ukrainian vote should be fair and transparent. While Karasin said constitutional reform in Ukraine should remain the top priority, his statement seemed to indicate a softening of Russia's previous stance that the presidential vote was premature and needed to be pushed back to the fall.Karasin refused to say if Moscow would recognize the outcome of the vote.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.

				If Russian President Vladimir Putin is allowed to get away with Crimea, he would feel freer to not only have Ukraine as a Russian protectorate but also assert Russian hegemony from the Baltic to Central Asia, says Haroon Siddiqui.
			Given the democratic and civilized way we’ve tackled Quebec separatism, Canada’s counsel should have counted for something regarding Sunday’s referendum in Crimea. But Stephen Harper has been sabre-rattling too much to be of any mediating benefit to anyone. In Crimea’s rushed referendum, there’s no clear question and there won’t be a clear majority. The ballot choice is not between yes and no — it is either yes to joining Russia or yes to autonomy that would pave the way for Russian annexation. The peninsula’s minority Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars, more than a third of the population, are boycotting the vote. They rightly do not want to lend legitimacy to the ethnic Russian majority’s machinations being carried out at Moscow’s behest.Under the 1991 terms of Ukrainian independence from the collapsed Soviet Union, Crimea was incorporated as part of Ukraine. A 1994 agreement signed by Ukraine, Russia, the U.S. and the U.K. obligated Moscow to “refrain from the threat or use of force against Ukraine’s territorial integrity.” The quid pro quo for that Budapest Memorandum was that Ukraine — then the third-largest nuclear power, with 1,900 long-range nuclear warheads and 2,500 shorter-range Soviet nuclear weapons — would give up that arsenal, which it did. The terms of a lease for the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Crimea require Moscow to seek Ukraine’s permission before moving its troops and equipment beyond its base in Sevastopol.Vladimir Putin’s line that he acted at the “direct request for military aid from a legitimate president,” the ousted Viktor Yanukovych, echoes the 1979 Soviet propaganda in invading Afghanistan — that it had been “invited” by Kabul. The thousands of unidentified “pro-Russian forces” operating in Crimea and the hundreds of armed thugs in Kyiv and in cities across eastern Ukraine are typical of mafia states. In Egypt, the army deploys the baltageya, axe wielders, who wade into crowds or take positions on rooftops as snipers. In Iran, the mysterious Baseejis, a “volunteer” wing of the Revolutionary Guards, crush pro-democracy forces by cracking skulls.Putin’s propaganda that the popular revolt in Kyiv was the work of neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic ultra-nationalists is being too readily repeated by our media. There are some such elements but the democratic movement is mostly liberal and, encouragingly, includes Russian-speaking Ukrainians.Putin is lying when he says that he is “only answering the call for fraternal assistance by Russian citizens.” Ukraine’s eight million ethnic Russians who speak the Russian language are citizens of Ukraine. In handing out Russian citizenship papers to some of those ethnic Russians, especially in Crimea, Russia is violating Ukrainian law, which does not allow dual citizenship. Ethnic Russians in Ukraine are far better protected than the five million to seven million Ukrainians living in Russia. Nearly a third of schools in Ukraine are in Russian language but there are no Ukrainian language schools in Russia. And the only major Ukrainian library in Moscow was vandalized recently.Putin invokes the tribalism of helping “our Russian compatriots.” By that measure, Turkey should be championing its ethnic-religious compatriots, the Tatars.The Ottoman Empire’s Crimean Khanate (governorate) extended up to Ukraine. Maidan, the Tahrir Square of Kyiv, is a Turkish word (of Arabic origin) for open space. The main square in Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, is also Moedano, the site of the 2003 Rose Revolution. When Czarist Russia took control of Crimea in 1783, it forced hundreds of thousands of Tatars out to Turkey. Today, between four million and six million Turks are of Tatar descent.Nor is Turkey a disinterested party in the geopolitical calculus. It is the NATO front-line state in the region. Its fighter jets have already intercepted a Russian spy plane and an American destroyer passed through Turkey’s Bosporus Straits on its way to the Black Sea.But it would be absurd for Turkey to wage war on Russia. It is not about to. Its choices are even more limited than those available to Europe and the United States. Like Europe, it depends on Russian gas. It also has Russian troops at its door, in Armenia. It has been paying the price of Russian support for Bashar Assad’s butchery in Syria that has sent 600,000 Syrian refugees into Turkey. It has no wish to pick a fight with Moscow, even while speaking up for the Tatars.The tepid American and European response to the Russian-Syrian axis only emboldened Putin, just as their non-reaction to his 2008 grab of the Georgian territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia (where also he handed out instant Russian citizenships).Crimea is the third test case. If allowed to get away now, Putin would feel freer to not only have Ukraine as a Russian protectorate but also assert Russian hegemony from the Baltic to Central Asia, to resurrect the old Soviet empire. The West does not want war. But its moral standing is weak in lecturing Putin — given Iraq, Afghanistan, East Timor, South Sudan, etc. The 1994 Budapest memo has no enforcing mechanisms. The U.S. needs Russian co-operation in Syria and Iran; in the passage of American equipment and troops in and out of Afghanistan; and Moscow’s continued compliance with the mutual nuclear arms reduction treaty. Still, the West is not helpless. Tough economic sanctions, of the kind imposed on apartheid-era South Africa, are called for.We value respectful and thoughtful discussion.
